The values entered are lost when the function returns and the contents of c in the display function are indeterminate producing undefined behavior (garbage output).
The program may seem to behave as expected if, by chance, the position and contents of the c array in both functions happens to be the same.
You should more the definition of the array to the main function and pass it to data_entry_of_customers() and display().
Here is a modified version:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef struct Customer {
    char name[20];
    int date;
    int month;
    int year;
    int amount;
    int type_of_account;
} cus;

void display(int n, cus c[n]);
void data_entry_of_customers(int n, cus c[n]);

int main() {
    int n, choices;

    printf(""\n Enter the number of customers : "");
    if (scanf(""%d"", &n) != 1)
        return 1;
    cus cus_array[n];

    for (;;) {
        printf(""\n Enter your choice :"");
        if (scanf(""%d"", &choices) != 1)

        switch (choices) {
        case 1:
            data_entry_of_customers(n, cus_array);
            break;

        case 2:
            display(n, cus_array);
            break;

        case 3:
            return 0;

        default:
            printf(""\n Invalid Choice\n"");
            break;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

void data_entry_of_customers(int n, cus c[n]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf(""\n Enter the name of the customer%d : "", i + 1);
        scanf(""%19s"", c[i].name);
        printf(""\n Enter the date when the account was opened by customer : "");
        scanf(""%d"", &c[i].date);
        printf(""\n Enter the month when the account was opened by customer : "");
        scanf(""%d"", &c[i].month);
        printf(""\n Enter the year when the account was opened by customer : "");
        scanf(""%d"", &c[i].year);
        printf(""\n Enter the amount deposited by the customer : "");

}

void display(int n, cus c[n]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf(""\n The name of the customer%d is %s"", i + 1, c[i].name);
        printf(""\n The date-month-year when the account was opened by customer%d is %d-%d-%d"", i + 1, c[i].date, c[i].month, c[i].year);
        printf(""\n The amount when the account was opened by customer%d is %d"", i + 1, c[i].amount);
        printf(""\n"");
    }
}
Note these remarks:
void display(int n, cus c[n]); defines a function that receives an int and a pointer to an array of cus structures. The prototype is equivalent to: void display(int n, cus c[]); and void display(int n, cus *c);... A possible improvement is to specify that the cus structures are not modified by the display function, thus change the prototype to void display(int n, const cus *c);
the return value of scanf should be tested to detect and handle invalid input. Writing separate functions to read a string and an integer would help make the code more reliable and readable.
Here is an alternate approach:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

Since you're filtering on multiple elements, this pattern isn't going to work either. You'll need to save all of your filters so you can remove one but keep the others when the box is unchecked. I like to use a Set for this purpose. You can then just filter the products on that set.
You also don't need to use state variables for constants that don't change.
Also, your ids and htmlFors need to be unique, or clicking on a label will always select the first box. It's simpler just to wrap the input with the label so you don't need to worry about it.

25,74585222,74584926,John Li,20436957,"Here is a minimal solution works without useEffect or changing category and products.
A few issues that can be addressed in posted code:
Each input need to have an unique id which matches htmlFor on label for the pair to work together.
When filterProducts sets a new state value, it does not get the updated value in the same block. Only use this event to set the filters in toCheck.
The value type of toCheck can be an object of [category]: Boolean so each category can be filtered separately, and filters can be combined as well.
The original products can be filtered before mapped, so there is no need to keep another state of newProducts, or to modify products data.

The test for spinner should be like that:
render the component
find the email input field and ""type"" there an email - use one of getBy* methods and then type with e.g. fireEvent.change(input, {target: {value: 'test@example.com'}})
find the password input field and ""type"" there a password - same as above
find the submit button and ""click"" it - use one of getBy* methods to find it and then use fireEvent to click it
this (I assume) should trigger your onSubmit which will call the handleLogin callback which will update the state and that will render the spinner.
check if spinner is in the document.

Rewrite to avoid Nz:

37,74588843,74584967,Gustav,3527297,"First, Access might think that the subquery may return more than one record, thus Top 1 should be used.
Next, it makes no sense to order the records to be inserted, as records per definition carries no order unless you specify this in the target table or the query where that table is used as source.
Also, even if you insisted to sort the insert, Access can't do this, as it doesn't know the output for AM.
Thus, this will run:
sSQL = ""SELECT tApplicant.applicationID, tApplicant.name, tApplicant.ID, tPreferences.fld3, "" & _
       ""NZ((SELECT Top 1 1 FROM tInfo WHERE tInfo.applicationID = tApplicant.applicationID), 0) AS AM "" _

       ""WHERE tPreferences.IDposit = "" & rsRos!ID & "";""

That said, Erik's suggestion to replace Nz with Exists is preferable as this will result in ""clean SQL"" which always will run faster:
sSQL = ""SELECT tApplicant.applicationID, tApplicant.name, tApplicant.ID, tPreferences.fld3, "" & _
       ""EXISTS (SELECT Top 1 1 FROM tInfo WHERE tInfo.applicationID = tApplicant.applicationID) AS AM "" _

}
Note these remarks:
void display(int n, cus c[n]); defines a function that receives an int and a pointer to an array of cus structures. The prototype is equivalent to: void display(int n, cus c[]); and void display(int n, cus *c);... A possible improvement is to specify that the cus structures are not modified by the display function, thus change the prototype to void display(int n, const cus *c);
the return value of scanf should be tested to detect and handle invalid input. Writing separate functions to read a string and an integer would help make the code more reliable and readable.

Since you're filtering on multiple elements, this pattern isn't going to work either. You'll need to save all of your filters so you can remove one but keep the others when the box is unchecked. I like to use a Set for this purpose. You can then just filter the products on that set.
You also don't need to use state variables for constants that don't change.
Also, your ids and htmlFors need to be unique, or clicking on a label will always select the first box. It's simpler just to wrap the input with the label so you don't need to worry about it.

66,74585222,74584926,John Li,20436957,"Here is a minimal solution works without useEffect or changing category and products.
A few issues that can be addressed in posted code:
Each input need to have an unique id which matches htmlFor on label for the pair to work together.
When filterProducts sets a new state value, it does not get the updated value in the same block. Only use this event to set the filters in toCheck.
The value type of toCheck can be an object of [category]: Boolean so each category can be filtered separately, and filters can be combined as well.
The original products can be filtered before mapped, so there is no need to keep another state of newProducts, or to modify products data.

82,74594134,74584892,chiliNUT,2079345,"I'll take a stab at this. Assuming I'm interpreting the spec's rules correctly (which I may not be) the section on how to handle error handling when parsing css would seem to allow for this.
a.) In The DOM standard for querySelector
The querySelector(selectors) method steps are to return the first result of running scope-match a selectors string selectors against this, if the result is not an empty list; otherwise null.
https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-parentnode-queryselector
b. ) That links to section 1.3. Selectors. Looking at section 1.3.1:
To scope-match a selectors string selectors against a node, run these steps:
Let s be the result of parse a selector selectors. [SELECTORS4]
c.) Parse a selector links off to the csswg v4 draft, which doesn't go into as much detail about error handling as the v3 draft. The v3 draft states (emphasis added by me):
§ 2.2. Error Handling
This section is not normative.
When errors occur in CSS, the parser attempts to recover gracefully, throwing away only the minimum amount of content before returning to parsing as normal. This is because errors aren’t always mistakes—new syntax looks like an error to an old parser, and it’s useful to be able to add new syntax to the language without worrying about stylesheets that include it being completely broken in older UAs.
The precise error-recovery behavior is detailed in the parser itself, but it’s simple enough that a short description is fairly accurate.
At the ""top level"" of a stylesheet, an starts an at-rule. Anything else starts a qualified rule, and is included in the rule’s prelude. This may produce an invalid selector, but that’s not the concern of the CSS parser—at worst, it means the selector will match nothing.
Once an at-rule starts, nothing is invalid from the parser’s standpoint; it’s all part of the at-rule’s prelude. Encountering a ends the at-rule immediately, while encountering an opening curly-brace <{-token> starts the at-rule’s body. The at-rule seeks forward, matching blocks (content surrounded by (), {}, or []) until it finds a closing curly-brace <}-token> that isn’t matched by anything else or inside of another block. The contents of the at-rule are then interpreted according to the at-rule’s own grammar.
Qualified rules work similarly, except that semicolons don’t end them; instead, they are just taken in as part of the rule’s prelude. When the first {} block is found, the contents are always interpreted as a list of declarations.
When interpreting a list of declarations, unknown syntax at any point causes the parser to throw away whatever declaration it’s currently building, and seek forward until it finds a semicolon (or the end of the block). It then starts fresh, trying to parse a declaration again.
If the stylesheet ends while any rule, declaration, function, string, etc. are still open, everything is automatically closed. This doesn’t make them invalid, though they may be incomplete and thus thrown away when they are verified against their grammar.
After each construct (declaration, style rule, at-rule) is parsed, the user agent checks it against its expected grammar. If it does not match the grammar, it’s invalid, and gets ignored by the UA, which treats it as if it wasn’t there at all.
https://drafts.csswg.org/css-syntax-3/#error-handling
Bullets 3-5 allow for a css rule to end without proper closing delimiters. In a stylesheet, a rule is a ""prelude"" (selector) followed by a set of css declarations wrapped in braces. A selector with no rules after it is invalid and discarded.
<style>
div[foo]
</style>
and is treated the same as a selector without a proper closing delimiter
<style>
div[foo
</style>
A selector with rules after it missing a closing ; and/or } is a complete selector + rule, and so it is still valid. Both of these are valid:
<style>
.foo {
    color:red;
</style>
or
<style>
.bar {
    color:blue
</style>
Finally, given that document.querySelector only requires a selector with no rule following it, I would conclude that a selector with a missing closing delimiter is valid according to the spec. You can see the same behavior with the :is pseudo class selector:
document.querySelector(""div:is(.foo"");
document.querySelector(""div:is([foo"");",2022-11-27 22:17:30Z,4

Edit: managing RAM requirements
One way that we can manage RAM requirements (for this, or any other algorithm on large datasets) is to find ways to divide-and-conquer.
If we look at our particular problem, each line in the input dataset leads to results that are independent of any other line. We can use this fact to apply our algorithm in batches.
But first, let's create some data that leads to a large problem:
min_time = 0
max_time = 1_000
nbr_groups = 400_000
min_df = (
    pl.DataFrame({""time_idx"": [list(range(min_time, max_time, 2))]})
    .join(
        pl.arange(0, nbr_groups, eager=True).alias(""group_idx"").to_frame(),
        how=""cross""
    )
)
min_df.explode('time_idx')

The input dataset when exploded is 200 million records .. so roughly the size you describe. (Of course, using divide-and-conquer, we won't explode the full dataset.)
To divide-and-conquer this, we'll slice our input dataset into smaller datasets, run the algorithm on the smaller datasets, and then concat the results into one large dataset. (One nice feature of slice is that it's very cheap - it's simply a window into the original dataset, so it consumes very little additional RAM.)
Notice the slice_size variable. You'll need to experiment with this value on your particular computing platform. You want to set this as large as your RAM requirements allow. If set too low, your program will take too long. If set too high, your program will crash. (I've arbitrarily set this to 10,000 as a starting value.)

Some other things
You do actually need to use the joins. The joins are used to fill in the ""holes"" in your sequences with null values.
Also, notice that I've put each slice/batch into lazy mode, but not the entire algorithm. Depending on your computing platform, using lazy mode for the entire algorithm may again overwhelm your system, as Polars attempts to spread the work across multiple processors which could lead to more out-of-memory situations for you.
Also note the humongous size of my output dataset: almost 400 million records. I did this purposely as a reminder that your output dataset may be the ultimate problem. That is, any algorithm would fail if the result dataset is larger than your RAM can hold.",2022-11-27 21:00:06Z,1

You can .explode(""subsequence"") afterwards to get a row per subsequence - this seems to be quite memory intensive though.
You can unnest([ ... ] subsequence) to do the explode in duckdb - it seems to be a bit slower currently.
Update: Using the explode_table() from https://issues.apache.org/jira/plugins/servlet/mobile#issue/ARROW-12099 seems to add very little overhead.

91,74585399,74584886,hpaulj,901925,"If you are too lazy, or ignorant, to do are ""proper"" 'vectorization', you can use np.vectorize. But you need to take time to really read its docs. It isn't magic. It can be useful, especially if you need to take advantage of broadcasting, and the function, some reason or other, only accepts scalars.
Rewriting your function to work with scalar inputs (though it also works fine with arrays, in this case):
In [91]: def foo(x,y): return x+y
    ...: f = np.vectorize(foo)
With scalar inputs:
In [92]: f(1,2)
Out[92]: array(3)
With 2 arrays (a (2,1) and (3,)), returning a (2,3):
In [93]: f(np.array([1,2])[:,None], np.arange(1,4))
Out[93]: 
array([[2, 3, 4],
       [3, 4, 5]])
Samething with meshgrid:
In [94]: I,J = np.meshgrid(np.array([1,2]), np.arange(1,4),indexing='ij')

In [95]: I
Out[95]: 
array([[1, 1, 1],
       [2, 2, 2]])

In [96]: J
Out[96]: 
array([[1, 2, 3],
       [1, 2, 3]])

In [97]: f(I,J)
Out[97]: 
array([[2, 3, 4],
       [3, 4, 5]])
Or meshgrid arrays as defined in [93]:
In [98]: I,J = np.meshgrid(np.array([1,2]), np.arange(1,4),indexing='ij', sparse=True)

In [99]: I,J
Out[99]: 
(array([[1],
        [2]]),
 array([[1, 2, 3]]))
But in a true vectorized sense, you can just add the 2 arrays:
In [100]: I+J
Out[100]: 
array([[2, 3, 4],
       [3, 4, 5]])
The first paragraph of np.vectorize docs (my emphasis):
Define a vectorized function which takes a nested sequence of objects or numpy arrays as inputs and returns a single numpy array or a tuple of numpy arrays. The vectorized function evaluates pyfunc over successive tuples of the input arrays like the python map function, except it uses the broadcasting rules of numpy.
edit
Starting with a function that expects a 2 element tuple, we could add a cover that splits it into two, and apply vectorize to that:
In [103]: def foo1(x): return x[0]+x[1]
     ...: def foo2(x,y): return foo1((x,y))
     ...: f = np.vectorize(foo2)

In [104]: f(1,2)
Out[104]: array(3)
X is a 2d element tuple:
In [105]: X = np.meshgrid(np.array([1,2]), np.arange(1,4),indexing='ij')

In [106]: X
Out[106]: 
[array([[1, 1, 1],
        [2, 2, 2]]),
 array([[1, 2, 3],
        [1, 2, 3]])]
which can be passed to f as:
In [107]: f(X[0],X[1])
Out[107]: 
array([[2, 3, 4],
       [3, 4, 5]])
But there's no need to slow things down with that iteration. Just pass the tuple to foo1:
In [108]: foo1(X)
Out[108]: 
array([[2, 3, 4],
       [3, 4, 5]])
In f = lambda x: x[0] + x[1] if x[0] > 0 else 0 you get the 'ambiguity' valueerror because if only works with scalars. But there are plenty of faster numpy ways of replacing such an if step.",2022-11-26 22:16:21Z,0

So I had a 1.8 RUNTIME, but the VS2019 build shell was finding the JDK1.7 compiler. Once I installed the 1.8 JDK, all was good.
So 80% of the time JRE is fine for me... it's just when I need the full JDK, DOH I need the full JDK.",2022-06-14 17:23:06Z,0

Cause: com/android/tools/idea/gradle/run/OutputBuildAction has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 55.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 53.0
I found several discussion on the Jetbrains YouTrack Forum: Failed to run Android project in the Idea 2020.3 EAP (OutputBuildAction has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 55.0)). The suggested workaround is to update the defined Gradle JDK version to JDK11, but many Android projects don't support Gradle JDK11, so does mine.
Another solution is to downgrade Android Studio from 2021.3.1 to 2021.2.1, and it worked for me. Hope it helps.",2022-10-24 07:20:24Z,0

135,74584908,74584859,matt,341994,"Basically this is the same as the question I answer here.
Foundation is not part of Swift, it's part of Cocoa, the older Objective-C library that preceded Swift by many, many years. Foundation's version of a string is NSString. But Swift String is ""bridged"" to NSString, so as soon as you import Foundation, a bunch of NSString methods spring to life as if they were part of Swift String even though they are not. In your case, you actually end up calling a completely different method which, as you've discovered, gives different results.
A good way to see this is to command-click on the term contains in your code (or even better, option-click it and then click Open in Developer Documentation):
If you have not imported Foundation (or UIKit), you jump to Swift String's contains.
If you have imported Foundation, you jump to Foundation's contains.
As for this part:
shouldn't the language indicate this somehow
I'm afraid Stack Overflow is not very good on ""should"" questions. I would say, yes, this is a little maddening, but it's part of the price we pay for the easy and seamless integration of Swift into the world of Cocoa programming. You could argue that the Swift people should not have named their method contains, but that train has left the station, and besides, it's a name that perfectly indicates what the method does.
Another thing to keep in mind is that you would probably never really use Swift except in the presence of Foundation (perhaps because you're in the presence of UIKit or SwiftUI or AppKit) so in practical terms the issue wouldn't arise. You've hit an unusual edge-case, which is commendable but, ex hypothesi, unusual.
To make things even more complicated, I think the Swift library method you encountered may have been just introduced as part of Xcode 14 and Swift 5.7 etc. See https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110354/?time=1415 for the WWDC '22 discussion of new String features. In earlier versions of Xcode, the phrase ""a"".contains("""") would not even have compiled in the absence of Foundation — and so the problem would never have arisen!",2022-11-26 19:43:39Z,7
