The program may seem to behave as expected if, by chance, the position and contents of the c array in both functions happens to be the same.
You should more the definition of the array to the main function and pass it to data_entry_of_customers() and display().
Here is a modified version:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef struct Customer {
    char name[20];
    int date;
    int month;
    int year;
    int amount;
    int type_of_account;
} cus;

void display(int n, cus c[n]);
void data_entry_of_customers(int n, cus c[n]);

int main() {
    int n, choices;

    printf(""\n Enter the number of customers : "");
    if (scanf(""%d"", &n) != 1)
        return 1;
    cus cus_array[n];

    for (;;) {
        printf(""\n Enter your choice :"");
        if (scanf(""%d"", &choices) != 1)

        switch (choices) {
        case 1:
            data_entry_of_customers(n, cus_array);
            break;

        case 2:
            display(n, cus_array);
            break;

        case 3:
            return 0;

        default:
            printf(""\n Invalid Choice\n"");
            break;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

void data_entry_of_customers(int n, cus c[n]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf(""\n Enter the name of the customer%d : "", i + 1);
        scanf(""%19s"", c[i].name);
        printf(""\n Enter the date when the account was opened by customer : "");
        scanf(""%d"", &c[i].date);
        printf(""\n Enter the month when the account was opened by customer : "");
        scanf(""%d"", &c[i].month);
        printf(""\n Enter the year when the account was opened by customer : "");
        scanf(""%d"", &c[i].year);
        printf(""\n Enter the amount deposited by the customer : "");
        scanf(""%d"", &c[i].amount);
    }
}

void display(int n, cus c[n]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf(""\n The name of the customer%d is %s"", i + 1, c[i].name);
        printf(""\n The date-month-year when the account was opened by customer%d is %d-%d-%d"", i + 1, c[i].date, c[i].month, c[i].year);
        printf(""\n The amount when the account was opened by customer%d is %d"", i + 1, c[i].amount);
        printf(""\n"");
    }
}
Note these remarks:
void display(int n, cus c[n]); defines a function that receives an int and a pointer to an array of cus structures. The prototype is equivalent to: void display(int n, cus c[]); and void display(int n, cus *c);... A possible improvement is to specify that the cus structures are not modified by the display function, thus change the prototype to void display(int n, const cus *c);
the return value of scanf should be tested to detect and handle invalid input. Writing separate functions to read a string and an integer would help make the code more reliable and readable.
Here is an alternate approach:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

Since you're filtering on multiple elements, this pattern isn't going to work either. You'll need to save all of your filters so you can remove one but keep the others when the box is unchecked. I like to use a Set for this purpose. You can then just filter the products on that set.
You also don't need to use state variables for constants that don't change.
Also, your ids and htmlFors need to be unique, or clicking on a label will always select the first box. It's simpler just to wrap the input with the label so you don't need to worry about it.

A few issues that can be addressed in posted code:
Each input need to have an unique id which matches htmlFor on label for the pair to work together.
When filterProducts sets a new state value, it does not get the updated value in the same block. Only use this event to set the filters in toCheck.
The value type of toCheck can an object of [category]: Boolean so each category can be filtered separately, and filters can be combined as well.
The original products can be filtered before mapped, so there is no need to keep another state of newProducts, or to modify products data.

The test for spinner should be like that:
render the component
find the email input field and ""type"" there an email - use one of getBy* methods and then type with e.g. fireEvent.change(input, {target: {value: 'test@example.com'}})
find the password input field and ""type"" there a password - same as above
find the submit button and ""click"" it - use one of getBy* methods to find it and then use fireEvent to click it
this (I assume) should trigger your onSubmit which will call the handleLogin callback which will update the state and that will render the spinner.
check if spinner is in the document.

32,14028959,canon,621962,"The element you were trying to find wasn’t in the DOM when your script ran.
The position of your DOM-reliant script can have a profound effect on its behavior. Browsers parse HTML documents from top to bottom. Elements are added to the DOM and scripts are (generally) executed as they're encountered. This means that order matters. Typically, scripts can't find elements that appear later in the markup because those elements have yet to be added to the DOM.
Consider the following markup; script #1 fails to find the <div> while script #2 succeeds:
<script>
  console.log(""script #1:"", document.getElementById(""test"")); // null
</script>
<div id=""test"">test div</div>
<script>
  console.log(""script #2:"", document.getElementById(""test"")); // <div id=""test"" ...
</script>

So, what should you do? You've got a few options:
Option 1: Move your script
Given what we've seen in the example above, an intuitive solution might be to simply move your script down the markup, past the elements you'd like to access. In fact, for a long time, placing scripts at the bottom of the page was considered a best practice for a variety of reasons. Organized in this fashion, the rest of the document would be parsed before executing your script:
<body>
  <button id=""test"">click me</button>
  <script>
    document.getElementById(""test"").addEventListener(""click"", function() {
      console.log(""clicked:"", this);
    });
  </script>
</body><!-- closing body tag -->
Run code snippetExpand snippet
While this makes sense and is a solid option for legacy browsers, it's limited and there are more flexible, modern approaches available.
Option 2: The defer attribute
While we did say that scripts are, ""(generally) executed as they're encountered,"" modern browsers allow you to specify a different behavior. If you're linking an external script, you can make use of the defer attribute.
[defer, a Boolean attribute,] is set to indicate to a browser that the script is meant to be executed after the document has been parsed, but before firing DOMContentLoaded.
This means that you can place a script tagged with defer anywhere, even the <head>, and it should have access to the fully realized DOM.
<script src=""https://gh-canon.github.io/misc-demos/log-test-click.js"" defer></script>
<button id=""test"">click me</button>
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Just keep in mind...
defer can only be used for external scripts, i.e.: those having a src attribute.
be aware of browser support, i.e.: buggy implementation in IE < 10
Option 3: Modules
Depending upon your requirements, you may be able to utilize JavaScript modules. Among other important distinctions from standard scripts (noted here), modules are deferred automatically and are not limited to external sources.
Set your script's type to module, e.g.:
<script type=""module"">
  document.getElementById(""test"").addEventListener(""click"", function(e) {
    console.log(""clicked: "", this);
  });
</script>
<button id=""test"">click me</button>
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Option 4: Defer with event handling
Add a listener to an event that fires after your document has been parsed.
DOMContentLoaded event
DOMContentLoaded fires after the DOM has been completely constructed from the initial parse, without waiting for things like stylesheets or images to load.
<script>
  document.addEventListener(""DOMContentLoaded"", function(e){
    document.getElementById(""test"").addEventListener(""click"", function(e) {
      console.log(""clicked:"", this);
    });
  });
</script>
<button id=""test"">click me</button>
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Window: load event
The load event fires after DOMContentLoaded and additional resources like stylesheets and images have been loaded. For that reason, it fires later than desired for our purposes. Still, if you're considering older browsers like IE8, the support is nearly universal. Granted, you may want a polyfill for addEventListener().
<script>
  window.addEventListener(""load"", function(e){
    document.getElementById(""test"").addEventListener(""click"", function(e) {
      console.log(""clicked:"", this);
    });
  });
</script>
<button id=""test"">click me</button>
Run code snippetExpand snippet
jQuery's ready()
DOMContentLoaded and window:load each have their caveats. jQuery's ready() delivers a hybrid solution, using DOMContentLoaded when possible, failing over to window:load when necessary, and firing its callback immediately if the DOM is already complete.
You can pass your ready handler directly to jQuery as $(handler), e.g.:
<script src=""https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js"" integrity=""sha256-H+K7U5CnXl1h5ywQfKtSj8PCmoN9aaq30gDh27Xc0jk="" crossorigin=""anonymous""></script>
<script>
  $(function() {
    $(""#test"").click(function() {
      console.log(""clicked:"", this);
    });
  });
</script>
<button id=""test"">click me</button>
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Option 5: Event Delegation
Delegate the event handling to an ancestor of the target element.
When an element raises an event (provided that it's a bubbling event and nothing stops its propagation), each parent in that element's ancestry, all the way up to window, receives the event as well. That allows us to attach a handler to an existing element and sample events as they bubble up from its descendants... even from descendants added after the handler was attached. All we have to do is check the event to see whether it was raised by the desired element and, if so, run our code.
Typically, this pattern is reserved for elements that don't exist at load time or to avoid attaching a large number of duplicate handlers. For efficiency, select the nearest reliable ancestor of the target element rather than attaching it to the document.
Native JavaScript
<div id=""ancestor""><!-- nearest ancestor available to our script -->
  <script>
    document.getElementById(""ancestor"").addEventListener(""click"", function(e) {
      if (e.target.id === ""descendant"") {
        console.log(""clicked:"", e.target);
      }
    });
  </script>
  <button id=""descendant"">click me</button>
</div>
Run code snippetExpand snippet
jQuery's on()
jQuery makes this functionality available through on(). Given an event name, a selector for the desired descendant, and an event handler, it will resolve your delegated event handling and manage your this context:
<script src=""https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js"" integrity=""sha256-H+K7U5CnXl1h5ywQfKtSj8PCmoN9aaq30gDh27Xc0jk="" crossorigin=""anonymous""></script>
<div id=""ancestor""><!-- nearest ancestor available to our script -->

33,14028959,"12 revs, 4 users 83%",14028960,"Short and simple: Because the elements you are looking for do not exist in the document (yet).
For the remainder of this answer I will use getElementById for examples, but the same applies to getElementsByTagName, querySelector, and any other DOM method that selects elements.
Possible Reasons
There are three reasons why an element might not exist:
An element with the passed ID really does not exist in the document. You should double check that the ID you pass to getElementById really matches an ID of an existing element in the (generated) HTML and that you have not misspelled the ID (IDs are case-sensitive!).
If you're using getElementById, be sure you're only giving the ID of the element (e.g., document.getElemntById(""the-id"")). If you're using a method that accepts a CSS selector (like querySelector), be sure you're including the # before the ID to indicate you're looking for an ID (e.g., document.querySelector(""#the-id"")). You must not use the # with getElementById, and must use it with querySelector and similar. Also note that if the ID has characters in it that aren't valid in CSS identifiers (such as a .; id attributes containing . characters are poor practice, but valid), you have to escape those when using querySelector (document.querySelector(""#the\\.id""))) but not when using getElementById (document.getElementById(""the.id"")).
The element does not exist at the moment you call getElementById.
The element isn't in the document you're querying even though you can see it on the page, because it's in an iframe (which is its own document). Elements in iframes aren't searched when you search the document that contains them.
If the problem is reason 3 (it's in an iframe or similar), you need to look through the document in the iframe, not the parent document, perhaps by getting the iframe element and using its contentDocument property to access its document (same-origin only). The rest of this answer addresses the first two reasons.
The second reason — it's not there yet — is quite common. Browsers parse and process the HTML from top to bottom. That means that any call to a DOM element which occurs before that DOM element appears in the HTML, will fail.
Consider the following example:
<script>
    var element = document.getElementById('my_element');
</script>

<div id=""my_element""></div>
The div appears after the script. At the moment the script is executed, the element does not exist yet and getElementById will return null.
jQuery
The same applies to all selectors with jQuery. jQuery won't find elements if you misspelled your selector or you are trying to select them before they actually exist.
An added twist is when jQuery is not found because you have loaded the script without protocol and are running from file system:
<script src=""//somecdn.somewhere.com/jquery.min.js""></script>
this syntax is used to allow the script to load via HTTPS on a page with protocol https:// and to load the HTTP version on a page with protocol http://
It has the unfortunate side effect of attempting and failing to load file://somecdn.somewhere.com...
Solutions
Before you make a call to getElementById (or any DOM method for that matter), make sure the elements you want to access exist, i.e. the DOM is loaded.
This can be ensured by simply putting your JavaScript after the corresponding DOM element
<div id=""my_element""></div>

<script>
    var element = document.getElementById('my_element');
</script>
in which case you can also put the code just before the closing body tag (</body>) (all DOM elements will be available at the time the script is executed).
Other solutions include listening to the load [MDN] or DOMContentLoaded [MDN] events. In these cases it does not matter where in the document you place the JavaScript code, you just have to remember to put all DOM processing code in the event handlers.
Example:
window.onload = function() {
    // process DOM elements here
};

// or

// does not work IE 8 and below
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // process DOM elements here
});
Please see the articles at quirksmode.org for more information regarding event handling and browser differences.
jQuery
First make sure that jQuery is loaded properly. Use the browser's developer tools to find out whether the jQuery file was found and correct the URL if it wasn't (e.g. add the http: or https: scheme at the beginning, adjust the path, etc.)
Listening to the load/DOMContentLoaded events is exactly what jQuery is doing with .ready() [docs]. All your jQuery code that affects DOM element should be inside that event handler.
In fact, the jQuery tutorial explicitly states:
As almost everything we do when using jQuery reads or manipulates the document object model (DOM), we need to make sure that we start adding events etc. as soon as the DOM is ready.
To do this, we register a ready event for the document.
$(document).ready(function() {
   // do stuff when DOM is ready
});
Alternatively you can also use the shorthand syntax:
$(function() {
    // do stuff when DOM is ready
});
Both are equivalent.",2021-08-31 08:42:48Z,167
34,14028959,Peter Mortensen,63550,"Reasons why id based selectors don't work
The element/DOM with id specified doesn't exist yet.
The element exists, but it is not registered in DOM [in case of HTML nodes appended dynamically from Ajax responses].
More than one element with the same id is present which is causing a conflict.
Solutions
Try to access the element after its declaration or alternatively use stuff like $(document).ready();
For elements coming from Ajax responses, use the .bind() method of jQuery. Older versions of jQuery had .live() for the same.
Use tools [for example, webdeveloper plugin for browsers] to find duplicate ids and remove them.",2017-11-12 00:54:00Z,18

36,14028959,Nathan Bubna,8131,"As @FelixKling pointed out, the most likely scenario is that the nodes you are looking for do not exist (yet).
However, modern development practices can often manipulate document elements outside of the document tree either with DocumentFragments or simply detaching/reattaching current elements directly. Such techniques may be used as part of JavaScript templating or to avoid excessive repaint/reflow operations while the elements in question are being heavily altered.
Similarly, the new ""Shadow DOM"" functionality being rolled out across modern browsers allows elements to be part of the document, but not query-able by document.getElementById and all of its sibling methods (querySelector, etc.). This is done to encapsulate functionality and specifically hide it.
Again, though, it is most likely that the element you are looking for simply is not (yet) in the document, and you should do as Felix suggests. However, you should also be aware that that is increasingly not the only reason that an element might be unfindable (either temporarily or permanently).",2013-12-06 17:29:33Z,14
37,14028959,CertainPerformance,9515207,"If script execution order is not the issue, another possible cause of the problem is that the element is not being selected properly:
getElementById requires the passed string to be the ID verbatim, and nothing else. If you prefix the passed string with a #, and the ID does not start with a #, nothing will be selected:
  <div id=""foo""></div>
  // Error, selected element will be null:
  document.getElementById('#foo')
  // Fix:
  document.getElementById('foo')
Similarly, for getElementsByClassName, don't prefix the passed string with a .:
  <div class=""bar""></div>
  // Error, selected element will be undefined:
  document.getElementsByClassName('.bar')[0]
  // Fix:
  document.getElementsByClassName('bar')[0]
With querySelector, querySelectorAll, and jQuery, to match an element with a particular class name, put a . directly before the class. Similarly, to match an element with a particular ID, put a # directly before the ID:
  <div class=""baz""></div>
  // Error, selected element will be null:
  document.querySelector('baz')
  $('baz')
  // Fix:
  document.querySelector('.baz')
  $('.baz')
The rules here are, in most cases, identical to those for CSS selectors, and can be seen in detail here.
To match an element which has two or more attributes (like two class names, or a class name and a data- attribute), put the selectors for each attribute next to each other in the selector string, without a space separating them (because a space indicates the descendant selector). For example, to select:
  <div class=""foo bar""></div>
use the query string .foo.bar. To select
  <div class=""foo"" data-bar=""someData""></div>
use the query string .foo[data-bar=""someData""]. To select the <span> below:
  <div class=""parent"">
    <span data-username=""bob""></span>
  </div>
use div.parent > span[data-username=""bob""].
Capitalization and spelling does matter for all of the above. If the capitalization is different, or the spelling is different, the element will not be selected:
  <div class=""result""></div>
  // Error, selected element will be null:
  document.querySelector('.results')
  $('.Result')
  // Fix:
  document.querySelector('.result')
  $('.result')
You also need to make sure the methods have the proper capitalization and spelling. Use one of:
$(selector)
document.querySelector
document.querySelectorAll
document.getElementsByClassName
document.getElementsByTagName
document.getElementById
Any other spelling or capitalization will not work. For example, document.getElementByClassName will throw an error.
Make sure you pass a string to these selector methods. If you pass something that isn't a string to querySelector, getElementById, etc, it almost certainly won't work.
If the HTML attributes on elements you want to select are surrounded by quotes, they must be plain straight quotes (either single or double); curly quotes like ‘ or ” will not work if you're trying to select by ID, class, or attribute.",2020-09-27 22:58:11Z,12

44,74584967,dimitris,4037170,"@ErikA and @Gustav 's answers pointed me to the right direction. Thank you both for your time.
The problem in this case was that I tried to use a subquery in the ORDER BY clause. Which I found out now that is not allowed. eg. see here
More over, I found this question, which makes mine a possible duplicate. Here it is suggested to wrap the query.
So I firstly SELECT the data in no order with the subquery and then, INSERT INTO the new table using ORDER BY with the new column of the subquery.
So I'm posting what finally worked for me.

The program may seem to behave as expected if, by chance, the position and contents of the c array in both functions happens to be the same.
You should more the definition of the array to the main function and pass it to data_entry_of_customers() and display().
Here is a modified version:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef struct Customer {
    char name[20];
    int date;
    int month;
    int year;
    int amount;
    int type_of_account;
} cus;

void display(int n, cus c[n]);
void data_entry_of_customers(int n, cus c[n]);

int main() {
    int n, choices;

    printf(""\n Enter the number of customers : "");
    if (scanf(""%d"", &n) != 1)
        return 1;
    cus cus_array[n];

    for (;;) {
        printf(""\n Enter your choice :"");

        switch (choices) {
        case 1:
            data_entry_of_customers(n, cus_array);
            break;

        case 2:
            display(n, cus_array);
            break;

        case 3:
            return 0;

        default:
            printf(""\n Invalid Choice\n"");
            break;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

void data_entry_of_customers(int n, cus c[n]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf(""\n Enter the name of the customer%d : "", i + 1);
        scanf(""%19s"", c[i].name);
        printf(""\n Enter the date when the account was opened by customer : "");
        scanf(""%d"", &c[i].date);
        printf(""\n Enter the month when the account was opened by customer : "");
        scanf(""%d"", &c[i].month);
        printf(""\n Enter the year when the account was opened by customer : "");
        scanf(""%d"", &c[i].year);
        printf(""\n Enter the amount deposited by the customer : "");
        scanf(""%d"", &c[i].amount);
    }
}

void display(int n, cus c[n]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf(""\n The name of the customer%d is %s"", i + 1, c[i].name);
        printf(""\n The date-month-year when the account was opened by customer%d is %d-%d-%d"", i + 1, c[i].date, c[i].month, c[i].year);
        printf(""\n The amount when the account was opened by customer%d is %d"", i + 1, c[i].amount);
        printf(""\n"");
    }
}
Note these remarks:
void display(int n, cus c[n]); defines a function that receives an int and a pointer to an array of cus structures. The prototype is equivalent to: void display(int n, cus c[]); and void display(int n, cus *c);... A possible improvement is to specify that the cus structures are not modified by the display function, thus change the prototype to void display(int n, const cus *c);
the return value of scanf should be tested to detect and handle invalid input. Writing separate functions to read a string and an integer would help make the code more reliable and readable.
Here is an alternate approach:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

Since you're filtering on multiple elements, this pattern isn't going to work either. You'll need to save all of your filters so you can remove one but keep the others when the box is unchecked. I like to use a Set for this purpose. You can then just filter the products on that set.
You also don't need to use state variables for constants that don't change.
Also, your ids and htmlFors need to be unique, or clicking on a label will always select the first box. It's simpler just to wrap the input with the label so you don't need to worry about it.

72,74584926,John Li,20436957,"Here is a minimal solution works without useEffect or changing category and products.
A few issues that can be addressed in posted code:
Each input need to have an unique id which matches htmlFor on label for the pair to work together.
When filterProducts sets a new state value, it does not get the updated value in the same block. Only use this event to set the filters in toCheck.
The value type of toCheck can an object of [category]: Boolean so each category can be filtered separately, and filters can be combined as well.
The original products can be filtered before mapped, so there is no need to keep another state of newProducts, or to modify products data.

80,14028959,canon,621962,"The element you were trying to find wasn’t in the DOM when your script ran.
The position of your DOM-reliant script can have a profound effect on its behavior. Browsers parse HTML documents from top to bottom. Elements are added to the DOM and scripts are (generally) executed as they're encountered. This means that order matters. Typically, scripts can't find elements that appear later in the markup because those elements have yet to be added to the DOM.
Consider the following markup; script #1 fails to find the <div> while script #2 succeeds:
<script>
  console.log(""script #1:"", document.getElementById(""test"")); // null
</script>
<div id=""test"">test div</div>
<script>
  console.log(""script #2:"", document.getElementById(""test"")); // <div id=""test"" ...
</script>
Run code snippetExpand snippet
So, what should you do? You've got a few options:
Option 1: Move your script
Given what we've seen in the example above, an intuitive solution might be to simply move your script down the markup, past the elements you'd like to access. In fact, for a long time, placing scripts at the bottom of the page was considered a best practice for a variety of reasons. Organized in this fashion, the rest of the document would be parsed before executing your script:
<body>
  <button id=""test"">click me</button>
  <script>
    document.getElementById(""test"").addEventListener(""click"", function() {
      console.log(""clicked:"", this);
    });
  </script>
</body><!-- closing body tag -->
Run code snippetExpand snippet
While this makes sense and is a solid option for legacy browsers, it's limited and there are more flexible, modern approaches available.
Option 2: The defer attribute
While we did say that scripts are, ""(generally) executed as they're encountered,"" modern browsers allow you to specify a different behavior. If you're linking an external script, you can make use of the defer attribute.
[defer, a Boolean attribute,] is set to indicate to a browser that the script is meant to be executed after the document has been parsed, but before firing DOMContentLoaded.
This means that you can place a script tagged with defer anywhere, even the <head>, and it should have access to the fully realized DOM.
<script src=""https://gh-canon.github.io/misc-demos/log-test-click.js"" defer></script>
<button id=""test"">click me</button>
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Just keep in mind...
defer can only be used for external scripts, i.e.: those having a src attribute.
be aware of browser support, i.e.: buggy implementation in IE < 10
Option 3: Modules
Depending upon your requirements, you may be able to utilize JavaScript modules. Among other important distinctions from standard scripts (noted here), modules are deferred automatically and are not limited to external sources.
Set your script's type to module, e.g.:
<script type=""module"">
  document.getElementById(""test"").addEventListener(""click"", function(e) {
    console.log(""clicked: "", this);
  });
</script>
<button id=""test"">click me</button>
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Option 4: Defer with event handling
Add a listener to an event that fires after your document has been parsed.
DOMContentLoaded event
DOMContentLoaded fires after the DOM has been completely constructed from the initial parse, without waiting for things like stylesheets or images to load.
<script>
  document.addEventListener(""DOMContentLoaded"", function(e){
    document.getElementById(""test"").addEventListener(""click"", function(e) {
      console.log(""clicked:"", this);
    });
  });
</script>
<button id=""test"">click me</button>
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Window: load event
The load event fires after DOMContentLoaded and additional resources like stylesheets and images have been loaded. For that reason, it fires later than desired for our purposes. Still, if you're considering older browsers like IE8, the support is nearly universal. Granted, you may want a polyfill for addEventListener().
<script>
  window.addEventListener(""load"", function(e){
    document.getElementById(""test"").addEventListener(""click"", function(e) {
      console.log(""clicked:"", this);
    });
  });
</script>
<button id=""test"">click me</button>
Run code snippetExpand snippet
jQuery's ready()
DOMContentLoaded and window:load each have their caveats. jQuery's ready() delivers a hybrid solution, using DOMContentLoaded when possible, failing over to window:load when necessary, and firing its callback immediately if the DOM is already complete.
You can pass your ready handler directly to jQuery as $(handler), e.g.:
<script src=""https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js"" integrity=""sha256-H+K7U5CnXl1h5ywQfKtSj8PCmoN9aaq30gDh27Xc0jk="" crossorigin=""anonymous""></script>
<script>
  $(function() {
    $(""#test"").click(function() {
      console.log(""clicked:"", this);
    });
  });
</script>
<button id=""test"">click me</button>
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Option 5: Event Delegation
Delegate the event handling to an ancestor of the target element.
When an element raises an event (provided that it's a bubbling event and nothing stops its propagation), each parent in that element's ancestry, all the way up to window, receives the event as well. That allows us to attach a handler to an existing element and sample events as they bubble up from its descendants... even from descendants added after the handler was attached. All we have to do is check the event to see whether it was raised by the desired element and, if so, run our code.
Typically, this pattern is reserved for elements that don't exist at load time or to avoid attaching a large number of duplicate handlers. For efficiency, select the nearest reliable ancestor of the target element rather than attaching it to the document.
Native JavaScript
<div id=""ancestor""><!-- nearest ancestor available to our script -->
  <script>
    document.getElementById(""ancestor"").addEventListener(""click"", function(e) {
      if (e.target.id === ""descendant"") {
        console.log(""clicked:"", e.target);
      }
    });
  </script>
  <button id=""descendant"">click me</button>
</div>
Run code snippetExpand snippet
jQuery's on()
jQuery makes this functionality available through on(). Given an event name, a selector for the desired descendant, and an event handler, it will resolve your delegated event handling and manage your this context:
<script src=""https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js"" integrity=""sha256-H+K7U5CnXl1h5ywQfKtSj8PCmoN9aaq30gDh27Xc0jk="" crossorigin=""anonymous""></script>
<div id=""ancestor""><!-- nearest ancestor available to our script -->
  <script>
    $(""#ancestor"").on(""click"", ""#descendant"", function(e) {
      console.log(""clicked:"", this);
    });

81,14028959,"12 revs, 4 users 83%",14028960,"Short and simple: Because the elements you are looking for do not exist in the document (yet).
For the remainder of this answer I will use getElementById for examples, but the same applies to getElementsByTagName, querySelector, and any other DOM method that selects elements.
Possible Reasons
There are three reasons why an element might not exist:
An element with the passed ID really does not exist in the document. You should double check that the ID you pass to getElementById really matches an ID of an existing element in the (generated) HTML and that you have not misspelled the ID (IDs are case-sensitive!).
If you're using getElementById, be sure you're only giving the ID of the element (e.g., document.getElemntById(""the-id"")). If you're using a method that accepts a CSS selector (like querySelector), be sure you're including the # before the ID to indicate you're looking for an ID (e.g., document.querySelector(""#the-id"")). You must not use the # with getElementById, and must use it with querySelector and similar. Also note that if the ID has characters in it that aren't valid in CSS identifiers (such as a .; id attributes containing . characters are poor practice, but valid), you have to escape those when using querySelector (document.querySelector(""#the\\.id""))) but not when using getElementById (document.getElementById(""the.id"")).
The element does not exist at the moment you call getElementById.
The element isn't in the document you're querying even though you can see it on the page, because it's in an iframe (which is its own document). Elements in iframes aren't searched when you search the document that contains them.
If the problem is reason 3 (it's in an iframe or similar), you need to look through the document in the iframe, not the parent document, perhaps by getting the iframe element and using its contentDocument property to access its document (same-origin only). The rest of this answer addresses the first two reasons.
The second reason — it's not there yet — is quite common. Browsers parse and process the HTML from top to bottom. That means that any call to a DOM element which occurs before that DOM element appears in the HTML, will fail.
Consider the following example:
<script>
    var element = document.getElementById('my_element');
</script>

<div id=""my_element""></div>
The div appears after the script. At the moment the script is executed, the element does not exist yet and getElementById will return null.
jQuery
The same applies to all selectors with jQuery. jQuery won't find elements if you misspelled your selector or you are trying to select them before they actually exist.
An added twist is when jQuery is not found because you have loaded the script without protocol and are running from file system:
<script src=""//somecdn.somewhere.com/jquery.min.js""></script>
this syntax is used to allow the script to load via HTTPS on a page with protocol https:// and to load the HTTP version on a page with protocol http://
It has the unfortunate side effect of attempting and failing to load file://somecdn.somewhere.com...
Solutions
Before you make a call to getElementById (or any DOM method for that matter), make sure the elements you want to access exist, i.e. the DOM is loaded.
This can be ensured by simply putting your JavaScript after the corresponding DOM element
<div id=""my_element""></div>

<script>
    var element = document.getElementById('my_element');
</script>
in which case you can also put the code just before the closing body tag (</body>) (all DOM elements will be available at the time the script is executed).
Other solutions include listening to the load [MDN] or DOMContentLoaded [MDN] events. In these cases it does not matter where in the document you place the JavaScript code, you just have to remember to put all DOM processing code in the event handlers.
Example:
window.onload = function() {
    // process DOM elements here
};

// or

// does not work IE 8 and below
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // process DOM elements here
});
Please see the articles at quirksmode.org for more information regarding event handling and browser differences.
jQuery
First make sure that jQuery is loaded properly. Use the browser's developer tools to find out whether the jQuery file was found and correct the URL if it wasn't (e.g. add the http: or https: scheme at the beginning, adjust the path, etc.)
Listening to the load/DOMContentLoaded events is exactly what jQuery is doing with .ready() [docs]. All your jQuery code that affects DOM element should be inside that event handler.
In fact, the jQuery tutorial explicitly states:
As almost everything we do when using jQuery reads or manipulates the document object model (DOM), we need to make sure that we start adding events etc. as soon as the DOM is ready.
To do this, we register a ready event for the document.
$(document).ready(function() {
   // do stuff when DOM is ready
});
Alternatively you can also use the shorthand syntax:
$(function() {
    // do stuff when DOM is ready
});
Both are equivalent.",2021-08-31 08:42:48Z,167
82,14028959,Peter Mortensen,63550,"Reasons why id based selectors don't work
The element/DOM with id specified doesn't exist yet.
The element exists, but it is not registered in DOM [in case of HTML nodes appended dynamically from Ajax responses].
More than one element with the same id is present which is causing a conflict.
Solutions
Try to access the element after its declaration or alternatively use stuff like $(document).ready();
For elements coming from Ajax responses, use the .bind() method of jQuery. Older versions of jQuery had .live() for the same.
Use tools [for example, webdeveloper plugin for browsers] to find duplicate ids and remove them.",2017-11-12 00:54:00Z,18

84,14028959,Nathan Bubna,8131,"As @FelixKling pointed out, the most likely scenario is that the nodes you are looking for do not exist (yet).
However, modern development practices can often manipulate document elements outside of the document tree either with DocumentFragments or simply detaching/reattaching current elements directly. Such techniques may be used as part of JavaScript templating or to avoid excessive repaint/reflow operations while the elements in question are being heavily altered.
Similarly, the new ""Shadow DOM"" functionality being rolled out across modern browsers allows elements to be part of the document, but not query-able by document.getElementById and all of its sibling methods (querySelector, etc.). This is done to encapsulate functionality and specifically hide it.
Again, though, it is most likely that the element you are looking for simply is not (yet) in the document, and you should do as Felix suggests. However, you should also be aware that that is increasingly not the only reason that an element might be unfindable (either temporarily or permanently).",2013-12-06 17:29:33Z,14
85,14028959,CertainPerformance,9515207,"If script execution order is not the issue, another possible cause of the problem is that the element is not being selected properly:
getElementById requires the passed string to be the ID verbatim, and nothing else. If you prefix the passed string with a #, and the ID does not start with a #, nothing will be selected:
  <div id=""foo""></div>
  // Error, selected element will be null:
  document.getElementById('#foo')
  // Fix:
  document.getElementById('foo')
Similarly, for getElementsByClassName, don't prefix the passed string with a .:
  <div class=""bar""></div>
  // Error, selected element will be undefined:
  document.getElementsByClassName('.bar')[0]
  // Fix:
  document.getElementsByClassName('bar')[0]
With querySelector, querySelectorAll, and jQuery, to match an element with a particular class name, put a . directly before the class. Similarly, to match an element with a particular ID, put a # directly before the ID:
  <div class=""baz""></div>
  // Error, selected element will be null:
  document.querySelector('baz')
  $('baz')
  // Fix:
  document.querySelector('.baz')
  $('.baz')
The rules here are, in most cases, identical to those for CSS selectors, and can be seen in detail here.
To match an element which has two or more attributes (like two class names, or a class name and a data- attribute), put the selectors for each attribute next to each other in the selector string, without a space separating them (because a space indicates the descendant selector). For example, to select:
  <div class=""foo bar""></div>
use the query string .foo.bar. To select
  <div class=""foo"" data-bar=""someData""></div>
use the query string .foo[data-bar=""someData""]. To select the <span> below:
  <div class=""parent"">
    <span data-username=""bob""></span>
  </div>
use div.parent > span[data-username=""bob""].
Capitalization and spelling does matter for all of the above. If the capitalization is different, or the spelling is different, the element will not be selected:
  <div class=""result""></div>
  // Error, selected element will be null:
  document.querySelector('.results')
  $('.Result')
  // Fix:
  document.querySelector('.result')
  $('.result')
You also need to make sure the methods have the proper capitalization and spelling. Use one of:
$(selector)
document.querySelector
document.querySelectorAll
document.getElementsByClassName
document.getElementsByTagName
document.getElementById
Any other spelling or capitalization will not work. For example, document.getElementByClassName will throw an error.
Make sure you pass a string to these selector methods. If you pass something that isn't a string to querySelector, getElementById, etc, it almost certainly won't work.
If the HTML attributes on elements you want to select are surrounded by quotes, they must be plain straight quotes (either single or double); curly quotes like ‘ or ” will not work if you're trying to select by ID, class, or attribute.",2020-09-27 22:58:11Z,12

It can be useful, especially if you need to take advantage of broadcasting, and the function, some reason or other, only accepts scalars.
Rewriting your function to work with scalar inputs (though it also works fine with arrays, in this case):
In [91]: def foo(x,y): return x+y
    ...: f = np.vectorize(foo)
With scalar inputs:
In [92]: f(1,2)
Out[92]: array(3)
With 2 arrays (a (2,1) and (3,)), returning a (2,3):
In [93]: f(np.array([1,2])[:,None], np.arange(1,4))
Out[93]: 
array([[2, 3, 4],
       [3, 4, 5]])
Samething with meshgrid:
In [94]: I,J = np.meshgrid(np.array([1,2]), np.arange(1,4),indexing='ij')

In [95]: I
Out[95]: 
array([[1, 1, 1],
       [2, 2, 2]])

In [96]: J
Out[96]: 
array([[1, 2, 3],
       [1, 2, 3]])

In [97]: f(I,J)
Out[97]: 
array([[2, 3, 4],
       [3, 4, 5]])
Or meshgrid arrays as defined in [93]:
In [98]: I,J = np.meshgrid(np.array([1,2]), np.arange(1,4),indexing='ij', sparse=True)

In [99]: I,J
Out[99]: 
(array([[1],
        [2]]),
 array([[1, 2, 3]]))
But in a true vectorized sense, you can just add the 2 arrays:
In [100]: I+J
Out[100]: 
array([[2, 3, 4],
       [3, 4, 5]])
The first paragraph of np.vectorize docs (my emphasis):
Define a vectorized function which takes a nested sequence of objects or numpy arrays as inputs and returns a single numpy array or a tuple of numpy arrays. The vectorized function evaluates pyfunc over successive tuples of the input arrays like the python map function, except it uses the broadcasting rules of numpy.
edit
Starting with a function that expects a 2 element tuple, we could add a cover that splits it into two, and apply vectorize to that:
In [103]: def foo1(x): return x[0]+x[1]
     ...: def foo2(x,y): return foo1((x,y))
     ...: f = np.vectorize(foo2)

In [104]: f(1,2)
Out[104]: array(3)
X is a 2d element tuple:
In [105]: X = np.meshgrid(np.array([1,2]), np.arange(1,4),indexing='ij')

In [106]: X
Out[106]: 
[array([[1, 1, 1],
        [2, 2, 2]]),
 array([[1, 2, 3],
        [1, 2, 3]])]
which can be passed to f as:
In [107]: f(X[0],X[1])
Out[107]: 
array([[2, 3, 4],
       [3, 4, 5]])
But there's no need to slow things down with that iteration. Just pass the tuple to foo1:
In [108]: foo1(X)
Out[108]: 
array([[2, 3, 4],
       [3, 4, 5]])
In f = lambda x: x[0] + x[1] if x[0] > 0 else 0 you get the 'ambiguity' valueerror because if only works with scalars. But there are plenty of faster numpy ways of replacing such an if step.",2022-11-26 22:16:21Z,0
103,74584885,mklement0,45375,"Since the use of .Verb = ""RunAs"" requires .UseShellExecute = true, and since the latter cannot be combined with RedirectStandardOutput = true, you cannot directly capture the elevated process' output in memory.

The workaround is to launch the target executable (dism.exe, in your case) indirectly, via a shell, and then use the latter's redirection feature (>) to capture the target executable's output (invariably) in a file, as shown below.

Second, this may be one of those cases where using native PS is easier than the cmdlet approach (admittedly, still not great).
If the script is supposed to run on clients as well as server operating systems: use Get-WmiObject or Get-CimInstance to get a reference to what you're running on. ActiveDirectory also has that information (in operatingSystem attribute).
For servers use Get-WindowsFeature in ServerManager module. For clients use Get-WindowsOptionalFeature with switch -Online in DISM module which, if you indeed need to support OSes older than 6.3.xxxx, can be copied over from a machine that has it and added to $Env:Path before C:\Windows and C:\Windows\System32.
For either platform just pass the list of features to configure.
If in a (binary) cmdlet you have to call external tools then the advantage of them is mostly gone. It may be possible to access Windows CBS using a managed API to avoid this but even then the script based approach gets more results faster, especially since you can just just put together a quick wrapper around dism.exe .",2022-11-27 13:32:10Z,0

I recently returned to Java after a foray into C# (a breath of fresh air) and installed Eclipse Oxygen onto a clean system that had never had Java installed on it before. This default everything with a brand new install of Eclipse Oxygen yet somehow or other Eclipse can't get its own parameters to match the jdk that's installed.

148,74584859,matt,341994,"Basically this is the same as the question I answer here.
Foundation is not part of Swift, it's part of Cocoa, the older Objective-C library that preceded Swift by many, many years. Foundation's version of a string is NSString. But Swift String is ""bridged"" to NSString, so as soon as you import Foundation, a bunch of NSString methods spring to life as if they were part of Swift String even though they are not. In your case, you actually end up calling a completely different method which, as you've discovered, gives different results.
A good way to see this is to command-click on the term contains in your code (or even better, option-click it and then click Open in Developer Documentation):
If you have not imported Foundation (or UIKit), you jump to Swift String's contains.
If you have imported Foundation, you jump to Foundation's contains.
As for this part:
shouldn't the language indicate this somehow
I'm afraid Stack Overflow is not very good on ""should"" questions. I would say, yes, this is a little maddening, but it's part of the price we pay for the easy and seamless integration of Swift into the world of Cocoa programming. You could argue that the Swift people should not have named their method contains, but that train has left the station, and besides, it's a name that perfectly indicates what the method does.
Another thing to keep in mind is that you would probably never really use Swift except in the presence of Foundation (perhaps because you're in the presence of UIKit or SwiftUI or AppKit) so in practical terms the issue wouldn't arise. You've hit an unusual edge-case, which is commendable but, ex hypothesi, unusual.
To make things even more complicated, I think the Swift library method you encountered may have been just introduced as part of Xcode 14 and Swift 5.7 etc. See https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110354/?time=1415 for the WWDC '22 discussion of new String features. In earlier versions of Xcode, the phrase ""a"".contains("""") would not even have compiled in the absence of Foundation — and so the problem would never have arisen!",2022-11-26 19:43:39Z,6

Option 1:
If all the data points in both files are from the same day, then I suggest the easiest thing to do is skip the date information in the file where it is present. I.e.
set timefmt ""%H:%M:%S""
set xrange [""17:20:00"":""18:47:00""]
plot 'xxx.csv' using (timecolumn(2, ""2022-11-24 %H:%M:%S"")):4 title ""aaa"" \
     'yyy.csv' using (timecolumn(1, ""%H:%M:%S"")):2 title ""bbb""
The string ""2022-11-24"" must match on input for the first file but it doesn't actually contribute to the date calculation.
Option 2:
If you really do care about the date, or if the first file spans multiple dates so that a constant string cannot match, then you could instead add a date component to the time string in the second file by concatenating a string constant containing the date.
myfmt = ""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S""
set timefmt ""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S""
set xrange [""2022-11-24 17:20:00"":""2022-11-24 18:47:00""]

Since you mentioned bash, to get what you wanted, you need to read the section of the bash man page for printf more closely.
The round brackets are used in AWK, C, others. Bash shows no mention of round brackets in the usage syntax. However, you need to add a ""format"" specifier (NOT same as AWK), but per the man page.
Your statement should be reworked to show as this:
printf ""%b\n"" ""\033[35m\033[K"" ""hello world"" ""\033[m\033[K""
OR ... you could just replace the printf ""%b\n"" with simply echo -e to get the same result.
Of possible interest, I also created for myself what I call a ""Bourne Header"" file, in which I defined some preset combinations with variable strings that can be re-used in other scripts by simply source'ing the *.bh file. I include it here for general usage.

Next, Get-ADGroupMember will not just return computer objects, but also users and other groups can be members of one particular group. Therefore, if you want to get output for computer objects only, you will need to filter out the other object types.
Luckily, each group member has a property called objectClass. This is a string containing either 'user', 'computer' or 'group', so it is realy quite easy to check on that:
# get all members of the group, filter with a Where-Object clause to receive only computer objects
$members = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity ""Groupname"" | Where-Object {$_.objectClass -eq 'computer'}

logic:
caret ^ is not supported by QUERY so we first transform ^2 into an alternative. we know x^2 is equal to x*x so we extract that 2 and subtract 1 and REPT *x one time
next, we need to add multiplication as ()() needs to become ()*() same as 50x to 50*x
then we substitute x with value and evaluate the string with QUERY's SQL ## logic:
basically, we transform your:

-50*(0)-1/2*(-9.81)*(0*0)+35
-50*(1)-1/2*(-9.81)*(1*1)+35

x^n where n is <1 are unachievable with REPT method and QUERY does not support roots so we can use a script to convert a text string into the formula

198,70745701,jcalz,2887218,"The issue here is that you have a value of union type (Section | Link)[] | [] and you're trying to call its filter() method, which is therefore also a union of function types. Taking a union of functions with differing call signatures and deciding which calls are safe is not a trivial task. Conceptually a union of call signatures should take an intersection of the parameters (due to contravariance of function/method parameters), but there are a lot of practical issues that make it harder.
Originally, TypeScript just gave up and didn't let you call such functions at all. See microsoft/TypeScript#7294. Then TypeScript 3.3 introduced support for calling some union types via a fix in microsoft/TypeScript#29011, which would synthesize a single call signature using the intersections of the parameters from the individual union members' call signatures, as long as no more than one member's call signature is overloaded and no more than one member's call signature is a generic. This improved things a lot, but in particular array methods tend to be generic and/or overloaded so unions of arrays still had few useful methods available. See microsoft/TypeScript#36390. A little more work has been done in microsoft/TypeScript#31023 to allow some generic methods to be called in unions, and as of now, only reduce() is completely uncallable for unions of functions. Still, it's not perfect, and microsoft/TypeScript#44373 is the currently open issue about this. Your filter() call is specifically trying to use the overloads where the callback is a user-defined type guard function, and that's just not supported at this time.
So for now there are only workarounds. My go-to workaround:
Generally speaking when you have an array of type Array<A> | Array<B> and you're only going to be reading from it, it should be safe to treat it as a value of type ReadonlyArray<A | B>. In fact, the compiler will generally let you perform this widening:
parentSection.children; //  (Section | Link)[] | []
const pc: readonly (Section | Link)[] = parentSection.children; // no error
Note that the element type for [] is the never type, so ReadonlyArray<A | B> in this case would be ReadonlyArray<(Section | Link) | never> which is just ReadonlyArray<Section | Link>.
Once you have a ReadonlyArray<A | B>, it's no longer a union type (its elements are union typed but not the array itself) and you can call filter() with impunity:
const sections = pc.filter((item): item is Section => !!item && item.type === 'section');
// const sections: Section[]
Note that you could shorten this to a one-liner:
const sections = (parentSection.children as readonly (Section | Link)[]).
  filter((item): item is Section => !!item && item.type === 'section');
// const sections: Section[]
but that's a bit less type safe since type assertions allow (unsafe) narrowing/downcasting as well as (safe) widening/upcasting, whereas type annotations on variables only allows widening/upcasting.
There are, of course, other viable workarounds (e.g., you mentioned using map(x => x), which works because of some of the above PRs, and then it becomes a single array type). Until and unless microsoft/TypeScript#44373 is addressed, you'll have to stick with your favorite workaround.

221,33891709,Michael Benjamin,3597276,"The Problem
This looks like a fundamental deficiency in flex layout.
A flex container in column-direction will not expand to accommodate additional columns. (This is not a problem in flex-direction: row.)
This question has been asked many times (see list below), with no clean answers in CSS.
It's hard to pin this as a bug because the problem occurs across all major browsers. But it does raise the question:
How is it possible that all major browsers got the flex container to expand on wrap in row-direction but not in column-direction?
You would think at least one of them would get it right. I can only speculate on the reason. Maybe it was a technically difficult implementation and was shelved for this iteration.
UPDATE: The issue appears to be resolved in Edge v16.
Illustration of the Problem
The OP created a useful demo illustrating the problem. I'm copying it here: http://jsfiddle.net/nwccdwLw/1/
Workaround Options
Hacky solutions from the Stack Overflow community:
""It seems this issue cannot be solved only with CSS, so I propose you a JQuery solution.""
""It's curious that most browsers haven't implemented column flex containers correctly, but the support for writing modes is reasonably good. Therefore, you can use a row flex container with a vertical writing mode.""

The tricky: set writing-mode: vertical-lr in the list div then writing-mode: horizontal-tb in the list item. I had to tweak the styles in the JSFiddle (remove a lot of the alignment styles, which aren't necessary for the solution).
Note: the comment says it only works in Chromium-based browsers, and not Firefox. I've only personally tested in Chrome. It's possible either there's a way to modify this to make it work in other browsers or there have been updates to said browsers that make this work.

226,33891709,Itay Gal,1034637,"Since no solution or proper workaround was suggested yet, I managed to obtain the requested behavior with a little different approach. Instead of separating the layout into 3 different divs, I'm adding all the items into 1 div and creating the separation with some more divs in between.
The proposed solution is hard coded, assuming we have 3 sections, but can be extended to a generic one. The main idea is to explain how we can achieve this layout.
Adding all the items into 1 container div that uses flex to wrap the items
The first item of each ""inner container"" (I'll call it a section) will have a class, which helps us to do some manipulations that create the separation and styling of each section.
Using :before on each first item, we can locate the title of each section.
Using space creates the gap between the sections
Since the space won't cover the full height of the section I'm also adding :after to the sections so positioning it with absolute position and white background.
To style the background color of each section I'm adding another div inside the first item of each section. I will be position with absolute as well and will have z-index: -1.
To get the correct width of each background, I'm using JS, setting the correct width, and also adding a listener to resize.
function calcWidth() {
  var size = $(document).width();
  var end = $("".end"").offset().left;

  var todoWidth = $("".doing-first"").offset().left;

235,18050071,"13 revs, 4 users 86%",18050072,"What are the syntax errors?
PHP belongs to the C-style and imperative programming languages. It has rigid grammar rules, which it cannot recover from when encountering misplaced symbols or identifiers. It can't guess your coding intentions.
Most important tips
There are a few basic precautions you can always take:
Use proper code indentation, or adopt any lofty coding style. Readability prevents irregularities.
Use an IDE or editor for PHP with syntax highlighting. Which also help with parentheses/bracket balancing.
Read the language reference and examples in the manual. Twice, to become somewhat proficient.
How to interpret parser errors
A typical syntax error message reads:
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING, expecting ';' in file.php on line 217
Which lists the possible location of a syntax mistake. See the mentioned file name and line number.
A moniker such as T_STRING explains which symbol the parser/tokenizer couldn't process finally. This isn't necessarily the cause of the syntax mistake, however.
It's important to look into previous code lines as well. Often syntax errors are just mishaps that happened earlier. The error line number is just where the parser conclusively gave up to process it all.
Solving syntax errors
There are many approaches to narrow down and fix syntax hiccups.
Open the mentioned source file. Look at the mentioned code line.
For runaway strings and misplaced operators, this is usually where you find the culprit.
Read the line left to right and imagine what each symbol does.
More regularly you need to look at preceding lines as well.
In particular, missing ; semicolons are missing at the previous line ends/statement. (At least from the stylistic viewpoint. )
If { code blocks } are incorrectly closed or nested, you may need to investigate even further up the source code. Use proper code indentation to simplify that.
Look at the syntax colorization!
Strings and variables and constants should all have different colors.
Operators +-*/. should be tinted distinct as well. Else they might be in the wrong context.
If you see string colorization extend too far or too short, then you have found an unescaped or missing closing "" or ' string marker.
Having two same-colored punctuation characters next to each other can also mean trouble. Usually, operators are lone if it's not ++, --, or parentheses following an operator. Two strings/identifiers directly following each other are incorrect in most contexts.
Whitespace is your friend. Follow any coding style.
Break up long lines temporarily.
You can freely add newlines between operators or constants and strings. The parser will then concretize the line number for parsing errors. Instead of looking at the very lengthy code, you can isolate the missing or misplaced syntax symbol.
Split up complex if statements into distinct or nested if conditions.
Instead of lengthy math formulas or logic chains, use temporary variables to simplify the code. (More readable = fewer errors.)
Add newlines between:
The code you can easily identify as correct,
The parts you're unsure about,
And the lines which the parser complains about.
Partitioning up long code blocks really helps to locate the origin of syntax errors.
Comment out offending code.
If you can't isolate the problem source, start to comment out (and thus temporarily remove) blocks of code.
As soon as you got rid of the parsing error, you have found the problem source. Look more closely there.
Sometimes you want to temporarily remove complete function/method blocks. (In case of unmatched curly braces and wrongly indented code.)
When you can't resolve the syntax issue, try to rewrite the commented out sections from scratch.
As a newcomer, avoid some of the confusing syntax constructs.
The ternary ? : condition operator can compact code and is useful indeed. But it doesn't aid readability in all cases. Prefer plain if statements while unversed.
PHP's alternative syntax (if:/elseif:/endif;) is common for templates, but arguably less easy to follow than normal { code } blocks.
The most prevalent newcomer mistakes are:
Missing semicolons ; for terminating statements/lines.
Mismatched string quotes for "" or ' and unescaped quotes within.
Forgotten operators, in particular for the string . concatenation.
Unbalanced ( parentheses ). Count them in the reported line. Are there an equal number of them?
Don't forget that solving one syntax problem can uncover the next.
If you make one issue go away, but other crops up in some code below, you're mostly on the right path.
If after editing a new syntax error crops up in the same line, then your attempted change was possibly a failure. (Not always though.)
Restore a backup of previously working code, if you can't fix it.
Adopt a source code versioning system. You can always view a diff of the broken and last working version. Which might be enlightening as to what the syntax problem is.
Invisible stray Unicode characters: In some cases, you need to use a hexeditor or different editor/viewer on your source. Some problems cannot be found just from looking at your code.
Try grep --color -P -n ""\[\x80-\xFF\]"" file.php as the first measure to find non-ASCII symbols.
In particular BOMs, zero-width spaces, or non-breaking spaces, and smart quotes regularly can find their way into the source code.
Take care of which type of linebreaks are saved in files.
PHP just honors \n newlines, not \r carriage returns.
Which is occasionally an issue for MacOS users (even on OS  X for misconfigured editors).
It often only surfaces as an issue when single-line // or # comments are used. Multiline /*...*/ comments do seldom disturb the parser when linebreaks get ignored.
If your syntax error does not transmit over the web: It happens that you have a syntax error on your machine. But posting the very same file online does not exhibit it anymore. Which can only mean one of two things:
You are looking at the wrong file!
Or your code contained invisible stray Unicode (see above). You can easily find out: Just copy your code back from the web form into your text editor.
Check your PHP version. Not all syntax constructs are available on every server.
php -v for the command line interpreter
<?php phpinfo(); for the one invoked through the webserver.

Those aren't necessarily the same. In particular when working with frameworks, you will them to match up.
Don't use PHP's reserved keywords as identifiers for functions/methods, classes or constants.
Trial-and-error is your last resort.
If all else fails, you can always google your error message. Syntax symbols aren't as easy to search for (Stack Overflow itself is indexed by SymbolHound though). Therefore it may take looking through a few more pages before you find something relevant.

White screen of death
If your website is just blank, then typically a syntax error is the cause. Enable their display with:
error_reporting = E_ALL
display_errors = 1
In your php.ini generally, or via .htaccess for mod_php, or even .user.ini with FastCGI setups.
Enabling it within the broken script is too late because PHP can't even interpret/run the first line. A quick workaround is crafting a wrapper script, say test.php:
<?php
   error_reporting(E_ALL);
   ini_set(""display_errors"", 1);
   include(""./broken-script.php"");
Then invoke the failing code by accessing this wrapper script.
It also helps to enable PHP's error_log and look into your webserver's error.log when a script crashes with HTTP 500 responses.",2019-01-09 14:13:36Z,315
236,18050071,"5 revs, 4 users 72%",18194929,"I think this topic is totally overdiscussed/overcomplicated. Using an IDE is THE way to go to completely avoid any syntax errors.

You'll (effectively) never run into syntax errors again, simply because you see them right as you type. Seriously.

237,18050071,"4 revs, 4 users 81%",29505827,"Unexpected [
These days, the unexpected [ array bracket is commonly seen on outdated PHP versions. The short array syntax is available since PHP >= 5.4. Older installations only support array().
$php53 = array(1, 2, 3);
$php54 = [1, 2, 3];
         ⇑
Array function result dereferencing is likewise not available for older PHP versions:
$result = get_whatever()[""key""];
                      ⇑
Reference - What does this error mean in PHP? - ""Syntax error, unexpected \["" shows the most common and practical workarounds.

BTW, there are also preprocessors and PHP 5.4 syntax down-converters if you're really clingy with older + slower PHP versions.
Other causes for Unexpected [ syntax errors
If it's not the PHP version mismatch, then it's oftentimes a plain typo or newcomer syntax mistake:
You can't use array property declarations/expressions in classes, not even in PHP 7.
protected $var[""x""] = ""Nope"";
              ⇑
Confusing [ with opening curly braces { or parentheses ( is a common oversight.
foreach [$a as $b)
        ⇑
Or even:
function foobar[$a, $b, $c] {
               ⇑
Or trying to dereference constants (before PHP 5.6) as arrays:
$var = const[123];
       ⇑
At least PHP interprets that const as a constant name.
If you meant to access an array variable (which is the typical cause here), then add the leading $ sigil - so it becomes a $varname.
You are trying to use the global keyword on a member of an associative array. This is not valid syntax:
global $var['key'];

Unexpected ] closing square bracket
This is somewhat rarer, but there are also syntax accidents with the terminating array ] bracket.
Again mismatches with ) parentheses or } curly braces are common:
function foobar($a, $b, $c] {
                          ⇑
Or trying to end an array where there isn't one:
$var = 2];
Which often occurs in multi-line and nested array declarations.
$array = [1,[2,3],4,[5,6[7,[8],[9,10]],11],12]],15];
                                             ⇑
If so, use your IDE for bracket matching to find any premature ] array closure. At the very least use more spacing and newlines to narrow it down.",2019-01-02 12:26:17Z,61
238,18050071,"9 revs, 6 users 89%",18092267,"Unexpected T_VARIABLE
An ""unexpected T_VARIABLE"" means that there's a literal $variable name, which doesn't fit into the current expression/statement structure.
Missing semicolon
It most commonly indicates a missing semicolon in the previous line. Variable assignments following a statement are a good indicator where to look:
        ⇓
 func1()
 $var = 1 + 2;     # parse error in line +2
String concatenation
A frequent mishap are string concatenations with forgotten . operator:
                                ⇓
 print ""Here comes the value: ""  $value;
Btw, you should prefer string interpolation (basic variables in double quotes) whenever that helps readability. Which avoids these syntax issues.
String interpolation is a scripting language core feature. No shame in utilizing it. Ignore any micro-optimization advise about variable . concatenation being faster. It's not.
Missing expression operators
Of course the same issue can arise in other expressions, for instance arithmetic operations:
            ⇓
 print 4 + 7 $var;
PHP can't guess here if the variable should have been added, subtracted or compared etc.
Lists
Same for syntax lists, like in array populations, where the parser also indicates an expected comma , for example:
                                       ⇓
 $var = array(""1"" => $val, $val2, $val3 $val4);
Or functions parameter lists:
                                 ⇓
 function myfunc($param1, $param2 $param3, $param4)
Equivalently do you see this with list or global statements, or when lacking a ; semicolon in a for loop.
Class declarations
This parser error also occurs in class declarations. You can only assign static constants, not expressions. Thus the parser complains about variables as assigned data:
 class xyz {      ⇓
     var $value = $_GET[""input""];
Unmatched } closing curly braces can in particular lead here. If a method is terminated too early (use proper indentation!), then a stray variable is commonly misplaced into the class declaration body.
Variables after identifiers
You can also never have a variable follow an identifier directly:
              ⇓
 $this->myFunc$VAR();
Btw, this is a common example where the intention was to use variable variables perhaps. In this case a variable property lookup with $this->{""myFunc$VAR""}(); for example.
Take in mind that using variable variables should be the exception. Newcomers often try to use them too casually, even when arrays would be simpler and more appropriate.
Missing parentheses after language constructs
Hasty typing may lead to forgotten opening or closing parenthesis for if and for and foreach statements:
        ⇓
 foreach $array as $key) {
Solution: add the missing opening ( between statement and variable.
                       ⇓
 if ($var = pdo_query($sql) {
      $result = …
The curly { brace does not open the code block, without closing the if expression with the ) closing parenthesis first.
Else does not expect conditions
     ⇓
else ($var >= 0)
Solution: Remove the conditions from else or use elseif.
Need brackets for closure
     ⇓
function() use $var {}
Solution: Add brackets around $var.
Invisible whitespace
As mentioned in the reference answer on ""Invisible stray Unicode"" (such as a non-breaking space), you might also see this error for unsuspecting code like:
<?php
                          ⇐
$var = new PDO(...);
It's rather prevalent in the start of files and for copy-and-pasted code. Check with a hexeditor, if your code does not visually appear to contain a syntax issue.

They're used in different contexts, but the syntax issue are quite similar. T_ENCAPSED… warnings occur in double quoted string context, while T_CONSTANT… strings are often astray in plain PHP expressions or statements.
Incorrect variable interpolation

                          ⇓     ⇓
echo ""Here comes a $wrong['array'] access"";
Quoting arrays keys is a must in PHP context. But in double quoted strings (or HEREDOCs) this is a mistake. The parser complains about the contained single quoted 'string', because it usually expects a literal identifier / key there.
More precisely it's valid to use PHP2-style simple syntax within double quotes for array references:
echo ""This is only $valid[here] ..."";
Nested arrays or deeper object references however require the complex curly string expression syntax:
echo ""Use {$array['as_usual']} with curly syntax."";
If unsure, this is commonly safer to use. It's often even considered more readable. And better IDEs actually use distinct syntax colorization for that.
Missing concatenation
If a string follows an expression, but lacks a concatenation or other operator, then you'll see PHP complain about the string literal:
                       ⇓
print ""Hello "" . WORLD  "" !"";
While it's obvious to you and me, PHP just can't guess that the string was meant to be appended there.
Confusing string quote enclosures
The same syntax error occurs when confounding string delimiters. A string started by a single ' or double "" quote also ends with the same.
                ⇓
print ""<a href=""' . $link . '"">click here</a>"";
      ⌞⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⌟⌞⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⌟⌞⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⌟
That example started with double quotes. But double quotes were also destined for the HTML attributes. The intended concatenation operator within however became interpreted as part of a second string in single quotes.
Tip: Set your editor/IDE to use slightly distinct colorization for single and double quoted strings. (It also helps with application logic to prefer e.g. double quoted strings for textual output, and single quoted strings only for constant-like values.)
This is a good example where you shouldn't break out of double quotes in the first place. Instead just use proper \"" escapes for the HTML attributes´ quotes:
print ""<a href=\""{$link}\"">click here</a>"";
While this can also lead to syntax confusion, all better IDEs/editors again help by colorizing the escaped quotes differently.
Missing opening quote
Equivalently are forgotten opening ""/' quotes a recipe for parser errors:
               ⇓
 make_url(login', 'open');
Here the ', ' would become a string literal after a bareword, when obviously login was meant to be a string parameter.
Array lists
If you miss a , comma in an array creation block, the parser will see two consecutive strings:
array(               ⇓
     ""key"" => ""value""
     ""next"" => ""...."",
);
Note that the last line may always contain an extra comma, but overlooking one in between is unforgivable. Which is hard to discover without syntax highlighting.
Function parameter lists
The same thing for function calls:
                         ⇓
myfunc(123, ""text"", ""and""  ""more"")
Runaway strings
A common variation are quite simply forgotten string terminators:
                                ⇓
mysql_evil(""SELECT * FROM stuffs);
print ""'ok'"";
      ⇑
Here PHP complains about two string literals directly following each other. But the real cause is the unclosed previous string of course.
HEREDOC indentation
Prior PHP 7.3, the heredoc string end delimiter can't be prefixed with spaces:
print <<< HTML
    <link..>
    HTML;
   ⇑
Solution: upgrade PHP or find a better hoster.

240,18050071,"9 revs, 6 users 73%",18092277,"Unexpected T_STRING
T_STRING is a bit of a misnomer. It does not refer to a quoted ""string"". It means a raw identifier was encountered. This can range from bare words to leftover CONSTANT or function names, forgotten unquoted strings, or any plain text.
Misquoted strings
This syntax error is most common for misquoted string values however. Any unescaped and stray "" or ' quote will form an invalid expression:
               ⇓                  ⇓
 echo ""<a href=""http://example.com"">click here</a>"";
Syntax highlighting will make such mistakes super obvious. It's important to remember to use backslashes for escaping \"" double quotes, or \' single quotes - depending on which was used as string enclosure.
For convenience you should prefer outer single quotes when outputting plain HTML with double quotes within.
Use double quoted strings if you want to interpolate variables, but then watch out for escaping literal "" double quotes.
For lengthier output, prefer multiple echo/print lines instead of escaping in and out. Better yet consider a HEREDOC section.

Another example is using PHP entry inside HTML code generated with PHP:
$text = '<div>some text with <?php echo 'some php entry' ?></div>'
This happens if $text is large with many lines and developer does not see the whole PHP variable value and focus on the piece of code forgetting about its source. Example is here
See also What is the difference between single-quoted and double-quoted strings in PHP?.
Unclosed strings
If you miss a closing "" then a syntax error typically materializes later. An unterminated string will often consume a bit of code until the next intended string value:
                                                       ⇓
echo ""Some text"", $a_variable, ""and some runaway string ;
success(""finished"");
         ⇯
It's not just literal T_STRINGs which the parser may protest then. Another frequent variation is an Unexpected '>' for unquoted literal HTML.
Non-programming string quotes
If you copy and paste code from a blog or website, you sometimes end up with invalid code. Typographic quotes aren't what PHP expects:
$text = ’Something something..’ + ”these ain't quotes”;
Typographic/smart quotes are Unicode symbols. PHP treats them as part of adjoining alphanumeric text. For example ”these is interpreted as a constant identifier. But any following text literal is then seen as a bareword/T_STRING by the parser.
The missing semicolon; again
If you have an unterminated expression in previous lines, then any following statement or language construct gets seen as raw identifier:
       ⇓
func1()
function2();
PHP just can't know if you meant to run two functions after another, or if you meant to multiply their results, add them, compare them, or only run one || or the other.
Short open tags and <?xml headers in PHP scripts
This is rather uncommon. But if short_open_tags are enabled, then you can't begin your PHP scripts with an XML declaration:
      ⇓
<?xml version=""1.0""?>
PHP will see the <? and reclaim it for itself. It won't understand what the stray xml was meant for. It'll get interpreted as constant. But the version will be seen as another literal/constant. And since the parser can't make sense of two subsequent literals/values without an expression operator in between, that'll be a parser failure.
Invisible Unicode characters
A most hideous cause for syntax errors are Unicode symbols, such as the non-breaking space. PHP allows Unicode characters as identifier names. If you get a T_STRING parser complaint for wholly unsuspicious code like:
<?php
    print 123;
You need to break out another text editor. Or an hexeditor even. What looks like plain spaces and newlines here, may contain invisible constants. Java-based IDEs are sometimes oblivious to an UTF-8 BOM mangled within, zero-width spaces, paragraph separators, etc. Try to reedit everything, remove whitespace and add normal spaces back in.
You can narrow it down with with adding redundant ; statement separators at each line start:
<?php
    ;print 123;
The extra ; semicolon here will convert the preceding invisible character into an undefined constant reference (expression as statement). Which in return makes PHP produce a helpful notice.
The `$` sign missing in front of variable names
Variables in PHP are represented by a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable.
The dollar sign ($) is a sigil that marks the identifier as a name of a variable. Without this sigil, the identifier could be a language keyword or a constant.
This is a common error when the PHP code was ""translated"" from code written in another language (C, Java, JavaScript, etc.). In such cases, a declaration of the variable type (when the original code was written in a language that uses typed variables) could also sneak out and produce this error.
Escaped Quotation marks
If you use \ in a string, it has a special meaning. This is called an ""Escape Character"" and normally tells the parser to take the next character literally.
Example: echo 'Jim said \'Hello\''; will print Jim said 'hello'
If you escape the closing quote of a string, the closing quote will be taken literally and not as intended, i.e. as a printable quote as part of the string and not close the string. This will show as a parse error commonly after you open the next string or at the end of the script.
Very common error when specifiying paths in Windows: ""C:\xampp\htdocs\"" is wrong. You need ""C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\"".
Typed properties
You need PHP ≥7.4 to use property typing such as:
public stdClass $obj;",2020-08-16 22:44:21Z,30
241,18050071,"7 revs, 3 users 91%",18092308,"Unexpected (
Opening parentheses typically follow language constructs such as if/foreach/for/array/list or start an arithmetic expression. They're syntactically incorrect after ""strings"", a previous (), a lone $, and in some typical declaration contexts.
Function declaration parameters
A rarer occurrence for this error is trying to use expressions as default function parameters. This is not supported, even in PHP7:
function header_fallback($value, $expires = time() + 90000) {
Parameters in a function declaration can only be literal values or constant expressions. Unlike for function invocations, where you can freely use whatever(1+something()*2), etc.
Class property defaults
Same thing for class member declarations, where only literal/constant values are allowed, not expressions:
class xyz {                   ⇓
    var $default = get_config(""xyz_default"");
Put such things in the constructor. See also Why don't PHP attributes allow functions?
Again note that PHP 7 only allows var $xy = 1 + 2 +3; constant expressions there.
JavaScript syntax in PHP
Using JavaScript or jQuery syntax won't work in PHP for obvious reasons:
<?php      ⇓
    print $(document).text();
When this happens, it usually indicates an unterminated preceding string; and literal <script> sections leaking into PHP code context.
isset(()), empty, key, next, current
Both isset() and empty() are language built-ins, not functions. They need to access a variable directly. If you inadvertently add a pair of parentheses too much, then you'd create an expression however:
          ⇓
if (isset(($_GET[""id""]))) {
The same applies to any language construct that requires implicit variable name access. These built-ins are part of the language grammar, therefore don't permit decorative extra parentheses.
User-level functions that require a variable reference -but get an expression result passed- lead to runtime errors instead.

Unexpected )
Absent function parameter
You cannot have stray commas last in a function call. PHP expects a value there and thusly complains about an early closing ) parenthesis.
              ⇓
callfunc(1, 2, );
A trailing comma is only allowed in array() or list() constructs.
Unfinished expressions
If you forget something in an arithmetic expression, then the parser gives up. Because how should it possibly interpret that:
               ⇓
$var = 2 * (1 + );
And if you forgot the closing ) even, then you'd get a complaint about the unexpected semicolon instead.
Foreach as constant
For forgotten variable $ prefixes in control statements you will see:
                   ↓    ⇓
foreach ($array as wrong) {
PHP here sometimes tells you it expected a :: instead. Because a class::$variable could have satisfied the expected $variable expression..

Unexpected {
Curly braces { and } enclose code blocks. And syntax errors about them usually indicate some incorrect nesting.
Unmatched subexpressions in an if
Most commonly unbalanced ( and ) are the cause if the parser complains about the opening curly { appearing too early. A simple example:
                              ⇓
if (($x == $y) && (2 == true) {
Count your parentheses or use an IDE which helps with that. Also don't write code without any spaces. Readability counts.
{ and } in expression context
You can't use curly braces in expressions. If you confuse parentheses and curlys, it won't comply to the language grammar:
           ⇓
$var = 5 * {7 + $x};
There are a few exceptions for identifier construction, such as local scope variable ${references}.
Variable variables or curly var expressions
This is pretty rare. But you might also get { and } parser complaints for complex variable expressions:
                      ⇓
print ""Hello {$world[2{]} !"";
Though there's a higher likelihood for an unexpected } in such contexts.

Unexpected }
When getting an ""unexpected }"" error, you've mostly closed a code block too early.
Last statement in a code block
It can happen for any unterminated expression.
And if the last line in a function/code block lacks a trailing ; semicolon:
function whatever() {
    doStuff()
}            ⇧
Here the parser can't tell if you perhaps still wanted to add + 25; to the function result or something else.
Invalid block nesting / Forgotten {
You'll sometimes see this parser error when a code block was } closed too early, or you forgot an opening { even:
function doStuff() {
    if (true)    ⇦
        print ""yes"";
    }
}   ⇧
In above snippet the if didn't have an opening { curly brace. Thus the closing } one below became redundant. And therefore the next closing }, which was intended for the function, was not associable to the original opening { curly brace.
Such errors are even harder to find without proper code indentation. Use an IDE and bracket matching.

Unexpected {, expecting (
Language constructs which require a condition/declaration header and a code block will trigger this error.
Parameter lists
For example misdeclared functions without parameter list are not permitted:
                 ⇓
function whatever {
}
Control statement conditions
And you can't likewise have an if without condition.
  ⇓
if {
}
Which doesn't make sense, obviously. The same thing for the usual suspects, for/foreach, while/do, etc.

Unexpected T_ELSEIF
Unexpected T_ELSE
Unexpected T_ENDIF
Conditional control blocks if, elseif and else follow a simple structure. When you encounter a syntax error, it's most likely just invalid block nesting → with missing { curly braces } - or one too many.
Missing { or } due to incorrect indentation
Mismatched code braces are common to less well-formatted code such as:
if((!($opt[""uniQartz5.8""]!=$this->check58)) or (empty($_POST['poree']))) {if
($true) {echo""halp"";} elseif((!$z)or%b){excSmthng(False,5.8)}elseif (False){
If your code looks like this, start afresh! Otherwise it's unfixable to you or anyone else. There's no point in showcasing this on the internet to inquire for help.
You will only be able to fix it, if you can visually follow the nested structure and relation of if/else conditionals and their { code blocks }. Use your IDE to see if they're all paired.
if (true) {
     if (false) {
              …
     }
     elseif ($whatever) {
         if ($something2) {
             …
         } 
         else {
             …
         }
     }
     else {
         …
     }
     if (false) {    //   a second `if` tree
         …
     }
     else {
         …
     }
}
elseif (false) {
    …
}
Any double } } will not just close a branch, but a previous condition structure. Therefore stick with one coding style; don't mix and match in nested if/else trees.
Apart from consistency here, it turns out helpful to avoid lengthy conditions too. Use temporary variables or functions to avoid unreadable if-expressions.
IF cannot be used in expressions
A surprisingly frequent newcomer mistake is trying to use an if statement in an expression, such as a print statement:
                   ⇓
echo ""<a href='"" . if ($link == ""example.org"") { echo …
Which is invalid of course.
You can use a ternary conditional, but beware of readability impacts.
echo ""<a href='"" . ($link ? ""http://yes"" : ""http://no"") . ""</a>"";
Otherwise break such output constructs up: use multiple ifs and echos.
Better yet, use temporary variables, and place your conditionals before:
if ($link) { $href = ""yes""; } else { $href = ""no""; }
echo ""<a href='$href'>Link</a>"";
Defining functions or methods for such cases often makes sense too.
Control blocks don't return ""results""
Now this is less common, but a few coders even try to treat if as if it could return a result:
$var = if ($x == $y) { ""true"" };
Which is structurally identical to using if within a string concatenation / expression.
But control structures (if / foreach / while) don't have a ""result"".
The literal string ""true"" would also just be a void statement.

You'll have to use an assignment in the code block:
if ($x == $y) { $var = ""true""; }
Alternatively, resort to a ?: ternary comparison.
If in If
You cannot nest an if within a condition either:
                    ⇓
if ($x == true and (if $y != false)) { ... }
Which is obviously redundant, because the and (or or) already allows chaining comparisons.
Forgotten ; semicolons
Once more: Each control block needs to be a statement. If the previous code piece isn't terminated by a semicolon, then that's a guaranteed syntax error:
                ⇓
$var = 1 + 2 + 3
if (true) { … }
Btw, the last line in a {…} code block needs a semicolon too.
Semicolon too early
Now it's probably wrong to blame a particular coding style, as this pitfall is too easy to overlook:
            ⇓
if ($x == 5);
{
    $y = 7;
}
else           ←
{
    $x = -1;    
}
Which happens more often than you might imagine.
When you terminate the if () expression with ; it will execute a void statement. The ; becomes a an empty {} of its own!
The {…} block thus is detached from the if, and would always run.
So the else no longer had a relation to an open if construct, which is why this would lead to an Unexpected T_ELSE syntax error.

Which also explains a likewise subtle variation of this syntax error:
if ($x) { x_is_true(); }; else { something_else(); };
Where the ; after the code block {…} terminates the whole if construct, severing the else branch syntactically.
Not using code blocks
It's syntactically allowed to omit curly braces {…} for code blocks in if/elseif/else branches. Which sadly is a syntax style very common to unversed coders. (Under the false assumption this was quicker to type or read).
However that's highly likely to trip up the syntax. Sooner or later additional statements will find their way into the if/else branches:
if (true)
    $x = 5;
elseif (false)
    $x = 6;
    $y = 7;     ←
else
    $z = 0;
But to actually use code blocks, you do have to write {…} them as such!
Even seasoned programmers avoid this braceless syntax, or at least understand it as an exceptional exception to the rule.
Else / Elseif in wrong order
One thing to remind yourself is the conditional order, of course.
if ($a) { … }
else { … }
elseif ($b) { … }
↑
You can have as many elseifs as you want, but else has to go last. That's just how it is.
Class declarations
As mentioned above, you can't have control statements in a class declaration:
class xyz {
    if (true) {
        function ($var) {}
    }
You either forgot a function definition, or closed one } too early in such cases.
Unexpected T_ELSEIF / T_ELSE
When mixing PHP and HTML, the closing } for an if/elseif must be in the same PHP block <?php ?> as the next elseif/else. This will generate an error as the closing } for the if needs to be part of the elseif:
<?php if ($x) { ?>
    html
<?php } ?>
<?php elseif ($y) { ?>
    html
<?php } ?>
The correct form <?php } elseif:
<?php if ($x) { ?>
    html
<?php } elseif ($y) { ?>
    html
<?php } ?>
This is more or less a variation of incorrect indentation - presumably often based on wrong coding intentions.
You cannot mash other statements inbetween if and elseif/else structural tokens:
if (true) {
}
echo ""in between"";    ←
elseif (false) {
}
?> text <?php      ←
else {
}
Either can only occur in {…} code blocks, not in between control structure tokens.
This wouldn't make sense anyway. It's not like that there was some ""undefined"" state when PHP jumps between if and else branches.
You'll have to make up your mind where print statements belong to / or if they need to be repeated in both branches.

Nor can you part an if/else between different control structures:
foreach ($array as $i) {
    if ($i) { … }
}
else { … }
There is no syntactic relation between the if and else. The foreach lexical scope ends at }, so there's no point for the if structure to continue.
T_ENDIF
If an unexpected T_ENDIF is complained about, you're using the alternative syntax style if: ⋯ elseif: ⋯ else: ⋯ endif;. Which you should really think twice about.
A common pitfall is confusing the eerily similar : colon for a ; semicolon. (Covered in ""Semicolon too early"")
As indentation is harder to track in template files, the more when using the alternative syntax - it's plausible your endif; does not match any if:.
Using } endif; is a doubled if-terminator.

While an ""unexpected $end"" is usually the price for a forgotten closing } curly brace.
Assignment vs. comparison
So, this is not a syntax error, but worth mentioning in this context:
       ⇓
if ($x = true) { }
else { do_false(); }
That's not a ==/=== comparison, but an = assignment. This is rather subtle, and will easily lead some users to helplessly edit whole condition blocks. Watch out for unintended assignments first - whenver you experience a logic fault / misbeheviour.",2019-10-10 20:01:53Z,15
243,18050071,"8 revs, 5 users 69%",29500670,"Unexpected $end
When PHP talks about an ""unexpected $end"", it means that your code ended while the parser is expecting more code. (The message is a bit misleading when taken literally. It's not about a variable named ""$end"", as sometimes assumed by newcomers. It refers to the ""end of file"", EOF.)
Cause: Unbalanced { and } for code blocks / and function or class declarations.
It's pretty much always about a missing } curly brace to close preceding code blocks. What it's saying is that the parser is expecting to find a closing } but actually reached the end of the file.
Again, use proper indentation to avoid such issues.
Use an IDE with bracket matching, to find out where the } is amiss. There are keyboard shortcuts in most IDEs and text editors:
NetBeans, PhpStorm, Komodo: Ctrl[ and Ctrl]
Eclipse, Aptana: CtrlShiftP
Atom, Sublime: Ctrlm - Zend Studio CtrlM
Geany, Notepad++: CtrlB - Joe: CtrlG - Emacs: C-M-n - Vim: %
Most IDEs also highlight matching braces, brackets and parentheses. Which makes it pretty easy to inspect their correlation:
Unterminated expressions
An Unexpected $end syntax/parser error can also occur for unterminated expressions or statements:
$var = func(1,  ?>EOF
So, look at the end of scripts first. A trailing ; is often redundant for the last statement in any PHP script. But you should have one. Precisely because it narrows such syntax issues down. Particularly after you find yourself adding more statements at the end of the script.
Indented HEREDOC markers
Another common occurrence appears with HEREDOC or NOWDOC strings. The terminating marker goes ignored with leading spaces, tabs, etc.:
print <<< END
    Content...
    Content....
  END;
# ↑ terminator isn't exactly at the line start
Therefore the parser assumes the HEREDOC string to continue until the end of the file (hence ""Unexpected $end""). Pretty much all IDEs and syntax-highlighting editors will make this obvious or warn about it.
Escaped Quotation marks
If you use \ in a string, it has a special meaning. This is called an ""Escape Character"" and normally tells the parser to take the next character literally.
Example: echo 'Jim said \'Hello\''; will print Jim said 'hello'
If you escape the closing quote of a string, the closing quote will be taken literally and not as intended, i.e. as a printable quote as part of the string and not close the string. This will show as a parse error commonly after you open the next string or at the end of the script.
Very common error when specifying paths in Windows: ""C:\xampp\htdocs\"" is wrong. You need ""C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\"". Alternately, PHP will usually convert Unix-style paths (e.g. ""C:/xampp/htdocs/"") to the correct path for Windows.
Alternative syntax
Somewhat rarer you can see this syntax error when using the alternative syntax for statement/code blocks in templates. Using if: and else: and a missing endif; for example.

Comparison operators such as ==, >=, ===, !=, <>, !== and <= or < and > mostly should be used just in expressions, such as if expressions. If the parser complains about them, then it often means incorrect paring or mismatched ( ) parens around them.
Parens grouping
In particular for if statements with multiple comparisons you must take care to correctly count opening and closing parenthesis:
                        ⇓
if (($foo < 7) && $bar) > 5 || $baz < 9) { ... }
                      ↑
Here the if condition here was already terminated by the )
Once your comparisons become sufficiently complex it often helps to split it up into multiple and nested if constructs rather.
isset() mashed with comparing
A common newcomer is pitfal is trying to combine isset() or empty() with comparisons:
                        ⇓
if (empty($_POST[""var""] == 1)) {
Or even:
                    ⇓
if (isset($variable !== ""value"")) {
This doesn't make sense to PHP, because isset and empty are language constructs that only accept variable names. It doesn't make sense to compare the result either, because the output is only/already a boolean.
Confusing >= greater-or-equal with => array operator
Both operators look somewhat similar, so they sometimes get mixed up:
         ⇓
if ($var => 5) { ... }
You only need to remember that this comparison operator is called ""greater than or equal"" to get it right.
See also: If statement structure in PHP
Nothing to compare against
You also can't combine two comparisons if they pertain the same variable name:
                 ⇓
if ($xyz > 5 and < 100)
PHP can't deduce that you meant to compare the initial variable again. Expressions are usually paired according to operator precedence, so by the time the < is seen, there'd be only a boolean result left from the original variable.
See also: unexpected T_IS_SMALLER_OR_EQUAL
Comparison chains
You can't compare against a variable with a row of operators:
                  ⇓
 $reult = (5 < $x < 10);
This has to be broken up into two comparisons, each against $x.
This is actually more a case of blacklisted expressions (due to equivalent operator associativity). It's syntactically valid in a few C-style languages, but PHP wouldn't interpret it as expected comparison chain either.
Unexpected >
Unexpected <
The greater than > or less than < operators don't have a custom T_XXX tokenizer name. And while they can be misplaced like all they others, you more often see the parser complain about them for misquoted strings and mashed HTML:
                        ⇓
print ""<a href='z"">Hello</a>"";
                 ↑
This amounts to a string ""<a href='z"" being compared > to a literal constant Hello and then another < comparison. Or that's at least how PHP sees it. The actual cause and syntax mistake was the premature string "" termination.
It's also not possible to nest PHP start tags:
<?php echo <?php my_func(); ?>
           ↑

Control constructs such as if, foreach, for, while, list, global, return, do, print, echo may only be used as statements. They usually reside on a line by themselves.
Semicolon; where you at?
Pretty universally have you missed a semicolon in the previous line if the parser complains about a control statement:
             ⇓
$x = myfunc()
if (true) {
Solution: look into the previous line; add semicolon.
Class declarations
Another location where this occurs is in class declarations. In the class section you can only list property initializations and method sections. No code may reside there.
class xyz {
    if (true) {}
    foreach ($var) {}
Such syntax errors commonly materialize for incorrectly nested { and }. In particular when function code blocks got closed too early.
Statements in expression context
Most language constructs can only be used as statements. They aren't meant to be placed inside other expressions:
                   ⇓
$var = array(1, 2, foreach($else as $_), 5, 6);
Likewise can't you use an if in strings, math expressions or elsewhere:
               ⇓
print ""Oh, "" . if (true) { ""you!"" } . "" won't work"";
// Use a ternary condition here instead, when versed enough.
For embedding if-like conditions in an expression specifically, you often want to use a ?: ternary evaluation.
The same applies to for, while, global, echo and a lesser extend list.
          ⇓
echo 123, echo 567, ""huh?"";
Whereas print() is a language built-in that may be used in expression context. (But rarely makes sense.)
Reserved keywords as identifiers
You also can't use do or if and other language constructs for user-defined functions or class names. (Perhaps in PHP 7. But even then it wouldn't be advisable.)
Your have a semi-colon instead of a colon (:) or curly bracket ({) after your control block
Control structures are typically wrapped in curly braces (but colons can be used in an alternative syntax) to represent their scope. If you accidentally use a semi-colon you prematurely close that block resulting in your closing statement throwing an error.

Invalid variable names
In PHP, and most other programming languages, variables cannot start with a number. The first character must be alphabetic or an underscore.
$1   // Bad
$_1  // Good
Quite often comes up for using preg_replace-placeholders ""$1"" in PHP context:
#                         ↓            ⇓  ↓
preg_replace(""/#(\w+)/e"",  strtopupper($1) )
Where the callback should have been quoted. (Now the /e regex flag has been deprecated. But it's sometimes still misused in preg_replace_callback functions.)
The same identifier constraint applies to object properties, btw.
       ↓
$json->0->value
While the tokenizer/parser does not allow a literal $1 as variable name, one could use ${1} or ${""1""}. Which is a syntactic workaround for non-standard identifiers. (It's best to think of it as a local scope lookup. But generally: prefer plain arrays for such cases!)
Amusingly, but very much not recommended, PHPs parser allows Unicode-identifiers; such that $➊ would be valid. (Unlike a literal 1).
Stray array entry
An unexpected long can also occur for array declarations - when missing , commas:
#            ↓ ↓
$xy = array(1 2 3);
Or likewise function calls and declarations, and other constructs:
func(1, 2  3);
function xy($z 2);
for ($i=2 3<$z)

So usually there's one of ; or , missing for separating lists or expressions.
Misquoted HTML
And again, misquoted strings are a frequent source of stray numbers:
#                 ↓ ↓          
echo ""<td colspan=""3"">something bad</td>"";
Such cases should be treated more or less like Unexpected T_STRING errors.

I think you're confusing two concepts here.
Yes, you're supposed to give Angular a new reference to the array/object to trigger the change detection (thus triggering a rerender)
BUT, you're not supposed to assign the attribute to some string value (in your case 'Row9'.
If you're trying to change the value of exactly one element, you can change it inline with this.arr[0].item = 'Row9'. However, as you might observe, no new render will follow your action. The content of the object in the array will change. If you wan't to trigger a new render / the change detection, you need to create a new reference to the array, e.g., this.arr = [...this.arr] (basically moving all list elements into a new list).",2022-11-26 18:54:01Z,2

Step 2. Based on build_cost, we calcualte the total_cost of a parts by required quantities (in order to compare with spaceship_required_part.amount) and take notes from where the parts are coming from in part_sources, which is in CSV format (city_id, stage, build_cost),...
Step 3. Once we have available parts and total qty & cost calculate, we join it with spaceship_required_part to get result like this:

291,23695448,Rob Napier,97337,"As Nate Finch notes:
Go run is ... really only meant to be used on very small programs, which generally only need a single file.
Even on unix, go run *.go is often not correct. In any project with unit tests (and every project should have unit tests), this will give the error:
go run: cannot run *_test.go files (something_test.go)
It will also ignore build restrictions, so _windows.go files will be compiled (or attempted to be compiled) on Unix, which is not what you want.
There has been a bit of discussion of making go run work like the rest of the go commands, and there's an open CL for it (5164). It's currently under consideration for Go 1.4. In the meantime, the recommended solution on all platforms is:
go build && ./<executable>",2014-05-16 13:03:51Z,75

go run *.go will be sufficient in most cases.
Continue to the below method if this causes errors.
Windows systems (and in other cases where go run *.go doesn't work)
Token expansion doesn't work in the windows command line and hence the above will not work and display an error. go run *.go may also not work in OSs in some cases due to current compiler limitations.
In these cases, use
go build && foo.exe
where foo.exe is the name of the .exe file produced. If perhaps you have no idea what the name of your executable is, first
go build and check the name of the .exe file produced. Afterwards, use the method that includes the file name.
These 2 methods will build and run all the .go files within your current directory with minimum fuss.",2016-05-07 03:28:40Z,26

304,74584683,BionicCode,3141792,"You must spend all participating controls a ItemsSource property. The idea is to delegate the source collection from the parent to the child controls and finally to the ListBox. The ItemsSource properties should be a dependency property of type IList and not IEnumerable. This way you force the binding source to be of type IList which improves the binding performance.
To allow customization of the actual displayed items, you must either
a) spend every control a ItemTemplate property of type DataTemplate and delegate it to the inner most ListBox.ItemTemplate (similar to the ItemsSource property) or
b) define the template as a resource (implicit template, which is a key less DataTemplate).

Ashamed to admit it but I realized the take profit / stop loss orders are additional separate orders you can send AFTER your first limit/market... order. This means you have to send 2 separate orders to Bianance. If we take a look at my example:
First I send a limit order to open a long/short position. Right after that I can send an equivalent but opposite take profit order (with reduceOnly parameter set to True; improtant!) which will close my position once the criteria are met.
So only after the first order is executed and a position is opened can the second order become ""active"" and close my position.

If event you're looking for happens to be non-first (e.g. as first event you may have keydown of 'ctrl' or mouse move, or window close event, ...), then it never gets processed. handleEvent has the same problem - it gets only first event in frame.
Generally speaking, event processing have to happen in a fast non-blocking loop, which handles events faster than new events are getting in. Processing only one event per frame is a not fast enough, and there is absolutely no reason to process only one event. Events gets accumulated in a queue, you process all events, draw your image frame (potentially slow), present on screen (potentially blocking on vsync), then repeat.
It looks counterintuitive that your event processing is split into two functions.
As I don't see the rest of your code, with ""minimal"" changes it should be something like:
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  DrawingWindow window = DrawingWindow(WIDTH, HEIGHT, false);
  SDL_Event event;
  while(true) {
    while(window.pollForInputEvents(event)) handleEvent(event);
    draw();
    window.renderFrame();
  }
}

bool DrawingWindow::pollForInputEvents(SDL_Event &event) {
    if (SDL_PollEvent(&event)) {
        if ((event.type == SDL_QUIT) || ((event.type == SDL_KEYDOWN) && (event.key.keysym.sym == SDLK_ESCAPE))) {
            SDL_DestroyTexture(texture);
            SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);
            SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
            SDL_Quit();
            printMessageAndQuit(""Exiting"", nullptr);
        }
        return true;
    }
    return false;

358,74584598,CertainPerformance,9515207,"In strict mode, state updater functions are invoked twice in an attempt to detect possible bugs.
Your code here does have an arguable bug - you're mutating the existing state in the Map here:
setCountdownTimers((prevState) => {
    console.log(prevState);
    for (const [timerKey, timer] of prevState) {
        prevState.set(timerKey, timer - 1);
    }
    return new Map(prevState);
});
Although you create a new Map when returning, you're still calling prevState.set - mutating it. This means that the second time the (strict) state updater runs, the Map it sees (in prevState the second time) has already had its values decremented once.
Instead of mutating the existing Map, create the new Map immediately, and only change that new Map.
function App() {
    const [countdownTimers, setCountdownTimers] = React.useState(new Map([[1, 60]]));

Strict mode can’t automatically detect side effects for you, but it can help you spot them by making them a little more deterministic. This is done by intentionally double-invoking the following functions:
Class component constructor, render, and shouldComponentUpdate methods
Class component static getDerivedStateFromProps method
Function component bodies
State updater functions (the first argument to setState)
Functions passed to useState, useMemo, or useReducer
Essentially, the callback passed to the setCountdownTimers setter is invoked twice, hence subtracting 2 instead of 1. It shouldn't happen in production.",2022-11-26 18:34:14Z,0

362,56302020,dpr,4323935,"Using @Scheduled will only allow to use static schedules. You can use properties to make the schedule configruable like this
@Scheduled(cron = ""${yourConfiguration.cronExpression}"")

// or

@Scheduled(fixedDelayString = ""${yourConfiguration.fixedDelay}"")
However the resulting schedule will be fixed once your spring context is initialized (the application is started).
To get fine grained control over a scheduled execution you need implement a custom Trigger - similar to what you already did. Together with the to be executed task, this trigger can be registered by implementing SchedulingConfigurer in your @Configuration class using ScheduledTaskRegistrar.addTriggerTask:
@Configuration
@EnableScheduling
public class AppConfig implements SchedulingConfigurer {
    @Override
    public void configureTasks(ScheduledTaskRegistrar taskRegistrar) {
        taskRegistrar.setScheduler(taskScheduler());
        taskRegistrar.addTriggerTask(() -> myTask().work(), myTrigger());
    }

    @Bean(destroyMethod=""shutdown"")
    public Executor taskScheduler() {
        return Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(42);
    }

    @Bean
    public CustomDynamicSchedule myTrigger() {
        new CustomDynamicSchedule();
    }

    @Bean
    public MyTask myTask() {
        return new MyTask();
    }
}
But don't do any registration of a task in the CustomDynamicSchedule just use it to compute the next execution time:
public class CustomDynamicSchedule extends DynamicSchedule implements Trigger {

    private long delayInterval;

    @Override
    public synchronized void increaseDelayInterval(Long delay) {
        this.delayInterval += delay;
    }

    @Override
    public synchronized void decreaseDelayInterval(Long delay) {
        this.delayInterval += delay;
    }

    @Override
    public synchronized void delay(Long delay) {
        this.delayInterval = delay;
    }

    @Override
    public Date nextExecutionTime(TriggerContext triggerContext) {
        Date lastTime = triggerContext.lastActualExecutionTime();
        return (lastTime == null) ? new Date() : new Date(lastTime.getTime() + delayInterval);
    }
}
But remember to make CustomDynamicSchedule thread safe as it will be created as singleton by spring and might be accessed by multiple threads in parallel.",2020-02-19 17:57:23Z,12
363,56302020,Mukul Bansal,7209547,"Spring's @Scheduled annotation does not provide this support.
This is my preferred implementation of a similar feature using a Queue-based solution which allows flexibility of timing and very robust implementation of this scheduler functionality.
This is the pipeline-
Cron Maintainer and Publisher- For every task, there is an affiliated cron and a single-threaded executor service which is responsible for publishing messages to the Queue as per the cron. The task-cron mappings are persisted in the database and are initialized during the startup. Also, we have an API exposed to update cron for a task at runtime.
We simply shut down the old scheduled executor service and create a one whenever we trigger a change in the cron via our API. Also, we update the same in the database.
Queue- Used for storing messages published by the publisher.
Scheduler- This is where the business logic of the schedulers reside. A listener on the Queue(Kafka, in our case) listens for the incoming messages and invokes the corresponding scheduler task in a new thread whenever it receives a message for the same.
There are various advantages to this approach. This decouples the scheduler from the schedule management task. Now, the scheduler can focus on business logic alone. Also, we can write as many schedulers as we want, all listening to the same queue and acting accordingly.",2019-05-27 10:42:47Z,1
364,56302020,evandongen,956884,"With annotation you can do it only by aproximation by finding a common denominator and poll it. I will show you later. If you want a real dynamic solution you can not use annotations but you can use programmatic configuration. The positive of this solution is that you can change the execution period even in runtime! Here is an example on how to do that:
  public initializeDynamicScheduledTAsk (ThreadPoolTaskScheduler scheduler,Date start,long executionPeriod) {
    scheduler.schedule(
      new ScheduledTask(),
      new Date(startTime),period
    );
    }
class ScheduledTask implements Runnable{


    @Override
    public void run() {
       // my scheduled logic here 
    }
}
There is a way to cheat and actually do something with annotations. But you can do that only if precision is not important. What does it mean precision. If you know that you want to start it every 5 seconds but 100ms more or less is not important. If you know that you need to start every 5-6-8 or 10 seconds you can configure one job that is executing every second and check within one if statement how long has it passed since the previous execution. It is very lame, but it works :) as long as you don't need up to millisecond precision. Here is an example:
public class SemiDynamicScheduledService {

private Long lastExecution;
@Value(#{yourDynamicConfiguration})
private int executeEveryInMS

@Scheduled(fixedDelay=1000)
public semiDynamicScheduledMethod() {
   if (System.currentTimeMS() - lastExecution>executeEveryInMS) {
      lastExecution = System.currentTimeMS();
      // put your processing logic here
   }

385,74584556,Cerberus,3003401,"This is impossible in general, due to Rust safety rules - callback borrows itself exclusively for the duration of the call, so you can't simultaneously borrow the whole struct again.
To see why this is not only a theoretical problem, consider this:
type Thunk = Box<dyn FnMut(&mut Config) + Send + 'static>;

struct Config {
    s: String,
    f: Thunk,
}

impl Config {

In this code, we have the callback which essentially drops itself while it is running. Since it captures s by-move, s is dropped along with callback. Then the callback tries to print s - and if that was allowed, we've had a use-after-free.
The solution will depend on the real requirements. The easiest way to go is to separate the configuration, passing to the Thunk only the part which doesn't contain the Thunk itself.",2022-11-27 05:45:07Z,2

It's November 2016 and the answer is finally Yes. But its only SHA-1 and SHA-256 (and by extension, SHA-224).
Intel CPUs with SHA extensions hit the market recently. It looks like processors which support it are Goldmont microarchitecture:
Pentium J4205 (desktop)
Pentium N4200 (mobile)
Celeron J3455 (desktop)
Celeron J3355 (desktop)
Celeron N3450 (mobile)
Celeron N3350 (mobile)
I looked through offerings at Amazon for machines with the architecture or the processor numbers, but I did not find any available (yet). I believe HP Acer had one laptop with Pentium N4200 expected to be available in November 2016 December 2016 that would meet testing needs.
For some of the technical details why it's only SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256, then see crypto: arm64/sha256 - add support for SHA256 using NEON instructions on the kernel crypto mailing list. The short answer is, above SHA-256, things are not easily parallelizable.
You can find source code for both Intel SHA intrinsics and ARMv8 SHA intrinsics at Noloader GitHub | SHA-Intrinsics. They are C source files, and provide the compress function for SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256. The intrinsic-based implementations increase throughput approximately 3× to 4× for SHA-1, and approximately 6× to 12× for SHA-224 and SHA-256.",2017-02-01 23:59:57Z,12

It was hoped that Intel's Skylake microarchitecture would have them, but it doesn't. Intel CPU's with it are low-power Goldmont in 2016, then Goldmont Plus in 2017. Intel's first mainstream CPU with SHA extensions will be Cannon Lake. Skylake / Kaby Lake / Coffee Lake do not.

409,37981475,FriendFX,897968,"The following happens:
Within func1, you created the local x variable and initialised it with a value, i.e. x is on the stack now.
You get the address of x and return it to main.
While returning, func1 and its variables x (and, irrelevant to the question, y) are freed, or popped off the stack, i.e. their memory locations are not reserved any more to hold their values. After this, any other part of the program is allowed to use the memory space that was allocated for x within func1, as func1 isn't active any more.
Your first printf call still happens to see the old value of the memory location where x used to be (but this is not guaranteed) and
the second printf call makes it apparent that something else (with the value of 0, such as the first printf's return value as described by R. Joiny) is (or was) using the same address as x within func1.
This article of the C Programming Boot Camp pretty much describes your situation:
A key to understanding the stack is the notion that when a function exits, all of its variables are popped off of the stack (and hence lost forever). Thus stack variables are local in nature. This is related to a concept we saw earlier known as variable scope, or local vs global variables. A common bug in C programming is attempting to access a variable that was created on the stack inside some function, from a place in your program outside of that function (i.e. after that function has exited).",2016-06-23 03:13:00Z,5
410,37981475,R. Joiny,5674968,"printf is basically a function. Like your func1.
Functions use some RAM, your workspace for local variables. If you leave the function, it becomes assingned as something like ""clear for using"" (not deleted!).
Because the first printf() comes directly after the func1() function, the local variable C is still there, because it's not overwritten yet. So that works. But if you look at this MAN page you can see, that printf has int as a return value. So that has to be written to somewhere, so what would your PC do? Of course write it to the first free adress of the RAM, that is assigned to your program. And there you have your zero.
It's important to notice, that no other program can access your RAM, Windows automatically reserves RAM for every process, so it must be the return value from printf() (or some other local variable that printf uses while executing).",2016-06-23 03:03:26Z,5
411,37981475,melpomene,1848654,"Since x is a local variable, I thought I would get an error when I try to return it.
A more general answer to this problem is: Wrong code in C code does not necessarily produce a compiler or runtime error.
If you're very lucky, you will get a compiler error or warning.
If you're lucky, you'll get a runtime crash when the wrong code runs (this often happens with null pointer errors). This is easy to track down with a debugger.
But if you're not lucky, wrong code can cause crashes later on (in seemingly unrelated code), or silently corrupt some data structures (making your program behave in weird ways without crashing), or even appear to work fine (until you add seemingly harmless code elsewhere, or use a different compiler, or a different version of the same compiler, or just different compilation options).
Technically your code has undefined behavior at this line:
int* c = func1();
You're using the return value of func1 (writing it into c). But that value is the address of a local variable in func1, which no longer exists by the time func has returned. That means the return value is an invalid pointer, and just using such a pointer leads to undefined behavior (you don't even have to dereference it).
printf(""%d\n"", *c); // output: 123123
Well, this line both uses the bad pointer (reading it from c) and dereferences it. The program still appears to work fine.
printf(""%d\n"", *c); // output: 0
A seemingly harmless addition, but this line doesn't produce the expected output. Now it looks like silent data corruption.
Note that none of this is guaranteed. A different compiler or the same compiler using different optimization settings may well produce code that behaves differently. As far as the standard is concerned, a compiler has to produce code that matches the observable behavior of the C code. But C code whose behavior is undefined can cause anything to happen; there are no guarantees or restrictions on what the compiler can do with it.",2016-06-23 05:08:57Z,5

422,74584495,Martin del Necesario,5677130,"Explanation
The code does exactly what you tell it to do. Let me elaborate: The method Integer.parseInt(...) takes a string as an argument and returns parsed integer that it could detect from that string. With ""0""+ x you are creating a concatenation of the string ""0"" and the number stored in x (23), resulting in the string ""023"". So you're calling the parseInt method actually like this: Integer.parseInt(""023""). Now, the resulting integer that is stored in b is 23.
In this case, that is the reaseon why System.out.println(b) outputs 23 and not 023. To give you a complete explanation: During the method call of println there is also something else happening. Java knows that the println method expects a string, but b is an Integer (first a primitive integer, but due to autoboxing, it gets converted to an object-integer automatically). In java, all objects have a toString method. Java implicitly calls this method for us, so we don't have to deal with it. But we have to know, that the string-representation of the object is defined in its toString method.
If you want to print a number differently than its default representation, you need to make sure that the resulting string looks the way you want it to.
Solution
You seem to be interested in changing the representation of the integer when printing to the output (System.out.println(...)). You have multiple options her, but the solution depends on your needs.
If you always want to prefix all your integers with ""0"": System.out.println(""0""+ x);
If you want to add leading zeros for numbers smaller than 100: System.out.printf(""%03d"", x);. (For numbers smaller than 1000 it would be System.out.printf(""%04d"", x);)
You could also use frameworks like Apache commons to achieve this:
String leadingZero = org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils.leftPad("""" + 8, 7, ""#"");
System.out.println(leadingZero);.

Drivers are designed to be deleted by WMI or the driver manager. It is a Windows Logo requirement.
Deleting the driver does not delete the files it just deletes the keys and connections between the OS and the driver. Remember that drivers are installed from ""inf"" files stored in the system folder. All drivers must reside there before then can be installed. Drivers are owned by Windows. They are not owned by the vendor. The vendor merely supplies a file that follows the OS rules for accessing the device. The vendor may supply other files to support specific software. In the case of adapter drivers, it is just glue between Windows and the adapter. Many adapters come with sophisticated utilities to monitor and manage the adapter. These are unnecessary outside of their utility. If the driver is removed they won't work but they will not cause an issue either.
First, disable the driver then delete it. As long as it is loaded you cannot delete it.

442,74584453,Axel Kemper,1911064,"As described in this article, the pseudocode of a bytecode interpreter is:
load the bytecode into memory
initialize interpreter state
repeat {
   fetch the next instruction,    advance the instruction pointer
   decode the instruction 
   execute the instruction
}
Depending on the bytecode format or structure, the instruction can have either fixed or dynamic length. Data like arrays or strings are typically referenced as (fixed length) memory offsets. The data is embedded in the bytecode separate from the instructions. The data address/offset is an index within the bytecode, as data is stored as sequence of bytes. An instruction to load a string would contain the string offset but not the string data itself.
To fetch and decode the next instruction, it is common to analyze the first one or two bytes which is/are usually the opcode. From this opcode, the length of the instruction is derived. The bytes belonging to the instruction can then be copied into a struct(ure) to disect it further and extract the instruction operand(s).
I can't see where a union would help in this process.

461,74584420,sehe,85371,"Good starting point there. Nice job.
Therefore I'm going to jump immediately to the pain point:
Writable property maps have to return something that models lvalue semantics. Your readJointAngles assumes a ""procedural"" conversion task instead. That's not a property map.
My first thought is to stay close to the concept of the property map by combining the read and write into a proxy class. The proxy class can be VertexProperties itself, but as I can imagine VertexProperties having multiple members with similar requirements, let me do the ""pure"" thing and have it separate here:
struct JointAngleWrapper {
    std::vector<double>& _ref;

    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, JointAngleWrapper wrapper) {
        for (auto sep = """"; auto el : wrapper._ref)
            os << std::exchange(sep, "","") << el;
        return os;
    }
    friend std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& is, JointAngleWrapper wrapper) {
        std::vector<double> tmp;

        while (is >> tmp.emplace_back())
            if (char comma{}; !(is >> comma) || comma != ',')
                break;

        wrapper._ref = std::move(tmp);

        is.clear();
        return is;
    }
};
Now you can replace the function property-map:
    auto jointAngles = boost::make_function_property_map<Vertex>(
        [ja = get(&VertexProperties::joint_angles, graph)](Vertex v) {
            return JointAngleWrapper{ja[v]};
        });
    dp.property(""Joint_Angles"", jointAngles);
And the output will still be identical. Actually, we have a more light-weight property map abstraction that fits the bill even more elegantly:
    auto jointAngles = make_transform_value_property_map(
        [](std::vector<double>& ja) { return JointAngleWrapper{ja}; },
        get(&VertexProperties::joint_angles, graph));
A Road Bump
However, function_property_map is still not an lvalue-property map. That's sad.
Turns out I forgot about this snag. I've written about this rather central issue with read_graphml (or with dynamic_properties, really) before:
Boost::Graph: how to import graphviz with custom Vertex class (which links to other relevant answers)
The approach I took there was to create my own ReadWritePropertyMap. Which is sensible, given that it essentially merges into what we already have above (JointAngleWrapper).
template <typename Prop> struct JA {
    Prop inner;
    JA(Prop map) : inner(map) { }

    // traits
    using value_type = std::string;
    using reference  = std::string;
    using key_type   = typename boost::property_traits<Prop>::key_type;
    using category   = boost::read_write_property_map_tag;

    friend std::string get(JA map, key_type const& key) {
        std::ostringstream oss;
        for (auto sep = """"; auto el : get(map.inner, key))
            oss << std::exchange(sep, "","") << el;
        return oss.str();
    }
    friend void put(JA map, key_type const& key, value_type const& value) {
        auto& v = get(map.inner, key);
        v.clear();

        std::istringstream iss(value);
        while (iss >> v.emplace_back())
            if (char comma{}; !(iss >> comma) || comma != ',')
                break;
    }
};
Now you can use it with success:
struct BoostGraph {
    Graph graph;

    auto properties() {
        boost::dynamic_properties dp;
        dp.property(""Joint_Angles"", JA{get(&VertexProperties::joint_angles, graph)});
        dp.property(""edge_weight"", get(&EdgeProperties::weight, graph));
        return dp;
    }

    void printGraphML(std::ostream& out) {
        write_graphml(out, graph, properties());
    }

    void readGraphGraphML(std::istream& file) {
        auto dp = properties();
        read_graphml(file, graph, dp);
    }
};
Which successfully roundtrips a ""random"" graph:
#include <boost/graph/random.hpp>
#include <random>

int main() {
    std::stringstream file; // fake file in memory
    {
        BoostGraph g;
        std::mt19937 prng{42};
        generate_random_graph(g.graph, 5, 2, prng);

        for (auto v : boost::make_iterator_range(vertices(g.graph)))
            for (auto& angle : g.graph[v].joint_angles)
                angle = std::uniform_real_distribution<double>(-M_PI, +M_PI)(prng);

        g.printGraphML(file);
    }

    {
        BoostGraph roundtrip;
        roundtrip.readGraphGraphML(file);

471,74584412,Chris,15261315,"MAIN DECLARATION:
Your code could benefit from an overall critique, so let's start with the main declaration. The standard clearly states that:
It [main] shall be defined with a return type of int and with no parameters.
There is a difference between
int main()
and
int main(void)
The first one takes an arbitrary amount of arguments, the second one doesn't.
MAGIC NUMBERS:
You have used the magic number 6, 5 times in the code. Consider using a define preprocessor instead:
#define MAX 6
It's easier to change and maintain. You wouldn't like changing 6 at a dozen places instead of just one.
NULL BYTE:
Replace the null byte '\0' with 0.
SIZE:
A common idiom in C to determine the size of an array is to use:
size_t size = sizeof (a) / sizeof (a[0]);
where sizeof(a) is the total number of bytes, and sizeof(a[0]) is the size of one element.
Though, you won't need to compute the size when you already have defined the size as a define statement?
RANDOM-NUMBER-GENERATOR:
The seed should only be set once. The answers to this question srand() — why call it only once? explain it in detail.
ACCESSING ILLEGAL MEMORY
for (i = 0; i <= 6; i++)
You're accessing memory outside of the bounds of the array, which is illegal. The memory not allocated should not be read.
Array-indexing starts at 0 instead of 1. So the sixth element of the array is at index position 5.
ORIGINAL PROBLEM:
You can use a for loop in the main function to print all the values of the array when you're done with all errors.
Consider changing the return type of the function to void as you do not need to return the array back to main when modifying it. The array decays to a pointer in the function parameter, so it's more of an alias. They both are pointing to the same memory, if you modify the memory through one or the other, the memory would be modified for both.
P.S: You may ask for clarifications if you found something unclear.",2022-11-26 19:34:41Z,1

When a new message is posted, you insert it into the database, including a DateTime column. Your message list page then just grabs the latest nn messages, ordered by newest first.
I'm assuming that you know how to do that. If not, do some reading about Entity Framework Core, as that provides a very good way of handling databases.
So, in princple, your question is no more complex than that. However, there are many variations on this, such as having the message list updated in real time, for which you should use SignalR, but without more specific explanation of what you want, it's hard to make any suggestions.",2022-11-26 19:54:29Z,0

Today 2020.06.20 I perform test on MacOs High Sierra on Chrome 81.0, Firefox 77.0 and Safari 13.1 for chosen solutions.
Conclusions for solutions which use precalculations
Solutions with precalculations (K,L) are (much much) faster than other solutions and will not be compared with them - probably they are use some special build-in browser optimisations
surprisingly on Chrome and Safari solution based on Map (K) are much faster than solution based on object {} (L)
surprisingly on Safari for small arrays solution based on object {} (L) is slower than traditional for (E)
surprisingly on Firefox for small arrays solution based on Map (K) is slower than traditional for (E)
Conclusions when searched objects ALWAYS exists
solution which use traditional for (E) is fastest for small arrays and fast for big arrays
solution using cache (J) is fastest for big arrays - surprisingly for small arrays is medium fast
solutions based on find (A) and findIndex (B) are fast for small arras and medium fast on big arrays
solution based on $.map (H) is slowest on small arrays
solution based on reduce (D) is slowest on big arrays
Conclusions when searched objects NEVER exists
solution based on traditional for (E) is fastest on small and big arrays (except Chrome-small arrays where it is second fast)
solution based on reduce (D) is slowest on big arrays
solution which use cache (J) is medium fast but can be speed up if we save in cache also keys which have null values (which was not done here because we want to avoid unlimited memory consumption in cache in case when many not existing keys will be searched)
Details
For solutions
without precalculations: A B C D E F G H I J (the J solution use 'inner' cache and it speed depend on how often searched elements will repeat)
with precalculations K L
I perform four tests. In tests I want to find 5 objects in 10 loop iterations (the objects ID not change during iterations) - so I call tested method 50 times but only first 5 times have unique id values:
small array (10 elements) and searched object ALWAYS exists - you can perform it HERE
big array (10k elements) and searched object ALWAYS exist - you can perform it HERE
small array (10 elements) and searched object NEVER exists - you can perform it HERE
big array (10k elements) and searched object NEVER exists - you can perform it HERE

514,7364150,Nick Parsons,5648954,"As others have pointed out, .find() is the way to go when looking for one object within your array. However, if your object cannot be found using this method, your program will crash:
const myArray = [{'id':'73','foo':'bar'},{'id':'45','foo':'bar'}];
const res = myArray.find(x => x.id === '100').foo; // Uh oh!
/*
Error:
""Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined""
or in newer chrome versions:
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'foo')
*/
Run code snippetExpand snippet
This can be fixed by checking whether the result of .find() is defined before using .foo on it. Modern JS allows us to do this easily with optional chaining, returning undefined if the object cannot be found, rather than crashing your code:
const myArray = [{'id':'73','foo':'bar'},{'id':'45','foo':'bar'}];
const res = myArray.find(x => x.id === '100')?.foo; // No error!
console.log(res); // undefined when the object cannot be found

In the real world, if you are processing a lot of items and performance is a concern it's much faster to initially build a lookup:
var items = [{'id':'73','foo':'bar'},{'id':'45','foo':'bar'}];

var lookup = items.reduce((o,i)=>o[i.id]=o,{});

536,71477787,Chris,17865804,"Below are given various options on how to convert an uploaded file to FastAPI into a Pandas DataFrame. If you would also like to convert the DataFrame into JSON and return it to the client, have a look at this answer. If you would like to use an async def endpoint instead of def, please have a look at this answer on how to read the file contents in an async way, as well as this answer to understand the difference between using def and async def. It would also be best to enclose the I/O operations (described in the options below) in try-except-finally blocks, so that you can catch/raise any possible exceptions and close the file object properly (as shown here and here).
Option 1
Since pandas.read_csv() can accept a file-like object, you can pass the file-like object of UploadFile directly. UploadFile exposes an actual Python SpooledTemporaryFile that you can get using the .file attribute. Example is given below. Note: The pd.read_csv() isn't an async method, and hence, if you are about to use async def endpoint, it would be better to read the contents of the file using an async method, as described here, and then pass the contents to pd.read_csv() using one of the reamining options below. Alternatively, you can use Starlette's run_in_threadpool() (as described here), which will run the pd.read_csv(file.file) in a separate thread to ensure that the main thread (where coroutines are run) does not get blocked.
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile
import pandas as pd

app = FastAPI()

@app.post(""/upload"")
def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    df = pd.read_csv(file.file)
    file.file.close()
    return {""filename"": file.filename}
Option 2
Convert the bytes into a string and then load it into an in-memory text buffer (i.e., StringIO), which can be converted into a dataframe:
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile
import pandas as pd
from io import StringIO

app = FastAPI()

@app.post(""/upload"")
def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    contents = file.file.read()
    s = str(contents,'utf-8')
    data = StringIO(s) 
    df = pd.read_csv(data)
    data.close()
    file.file.close()
    return {""filename"": file.filename}
Option 3
Use an in-memory bytes buffer instead (i.e., BytesIO), thus saving you the step of converting the bytes into a string as shown in Option 2:
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile
import pandas as pd
from io import BytesIO
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

@app.post(""/upload"")
def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    contents = file.file.read()
    data = BytesIO(contents)
    df = pd.read_csv(data)
    data.close()
    file.file.close()

There are a couple of standard reasons to not directly create Pods, but instead to rely on higher-level constructs. A Deployment can do zero-downtime upgrades; a StatefulSet manages associated PersistentVolumeClaims; a Job can retry on failure. A Pod also can't be edited once created, so you'd need to delete and recreate the Pod on any update. If you're using a Deployment you'll have Pod names like deployment-name-12345678-abcde, but you don't control the ending parts at all. A Service will give you a consistent name.
During an upgrade there won't necessarily be exactly the requested number of replicas:. A Deployment by default will create an additional Pod, wait for it to pass its liveness checks, then tear down the old Pod; an associated Service will route traffic correctly in this case. The alternative is to tear down the old Pod first. In both cases, you could have zero or two matching Pods and not just one.
Having the Service as the standard pattern also helps if you do ever decide to increase the replica count; for example you might choose to run multiple replicas just for additional resiliency in case ons of the Nodes fails.

Moreover, a string literal always refers to the same instance of class String. This is because string literals - or, more generally, strings that are the values of constant expressions (§15.28) - are ""interned"" so as to share unique instances, using the method String.intern.
Similar examples can also be found in JLS 3.10.5-1.

Sometimes it looks as if == compares values, because Java does some behind-the-scenes stuff to make sure identical in-line strings are actually the same object.
For example:

String fooString2 = new String(""foo"");

// Evaluates to false
fooString1 == fooString2;

// Evaluates to true
fooString1.equals(fooString2);

// Evaluates to true, because Java uses the same object

But beware of nulls!
== handles null strings fine, but calling .equals() from a null string will cause an exception:
String nullString1 = null;
String nullString2 = null;

// Evaluates to true
System.out.print(nullString1 == nullString2);

// Throws a NullPointerException
System.out.print(nullString1.equals(nullString2));
So if you know that fooString1 may be null, tell the reader that by writing
System.out.print(fooString1 != null && fooString1.equals(""bar""));
The following are shorter, but it’s less obvious that it checks for null:

Sometimes == gives illusions of comparing String values, as in following cases:

String b=""Test"";
if(a==b) ===> true
This is because when you create any String literal, the JVM first searches for that literal in the String pool, and if it finds a match, that same reference will be given to the new String. Because of this, we get:
(a==b) ===> true
                       String Pool

However, == fails in the following case:
String a=""test"";
String b=new String(""test"");
if (a==b) ===> false
In this case for new String(""test"") the statement new String will be created on the heap, and that reference will be given to b, so b will be given a reference on the heap, not in String pool.
Now a is pointing to a String in the String pool while b is pointing to a String on the heap. Because of that we get:

This has been done so that these string instances can be cached. A typical program contains a lot of string references and caching these instances can decrease the memory footprint and increase the performance of the program.
When using == operator for string comparison you are not comparing the contents of the string, but are actually comparing the memory address. If they are both equal it will return true and false otherwise. Whereas equals in string compares the string contents.
So the question is if all the strings are cached in the system, how come == returns false whereas equals return true? Well, this is possible. If you make a new string like String str = new String(""Testing"") you end up creating a new string in the cache even if the cache already contains a string having the same content. In short ""MyString"" == new String(""MyString"") will always return false.
Java also talks about the function intern() that can be used on a string to make it part of the cache so ""MyString"" == new String(""MyString"").intern() will return true.

Definitely the use of the equals() method is recommended.
Don't worry about the performance. Some things to encourage using String.equals():
Implementation of String.equals() first checks for reference equality (using ==), and if the 2 strings are the same by reference, no further calculation is performed!
If the 2 string references are not the same, String.equals() will next check the lengths of the strings. This is also a fast operation because the String class stores the length of the string, no need to count the characters or code points. If the lengths differ, no further check is performed, we know they cannot be equal.
Only if we got this far will the contents of the 2 strings be actually compared, and this will be a short-hand comparison: not all the characters will be compared, if we find a mismatching character (at the same position in the 2 strings), no further characters will be checked.
When all is said and done, even if we have a guarantee that the strings are interns, using the equals() method is still not that overhead that one might think, definitely the recommended way.

In this tutorial I'll demonstrate several different ways to correctly compare Java strings, starting with the approach I use most of the time. At the end of this Java String comparison tutorial I'll also discuss why the ""=="" operator doesn't work when comparing Java strings.
Option 1: Java String comparison with the equals method Most of the time (maybe 95% of the time) I compare strings with the equals method of the Java String class, like this:
if (string1.equals(string2))
This String equals method looks at the two Java strings, and if they contain the exact same string of characters, they are considered equal.
Taking a look at a quick String comparison example with the equals method, if the following test were run, the two strings would not be considered equal because the characters are not the exactly the same (the case of the characters is different):
String string1 = ""foo"";
String string2 = ""FOO"";

if (string1.equals(string2))
{
    // this line will not print because the
    // java string equals method returns false:
    System.out.println(""The two strings are the same."")
}
But, when the two strings contain the exact same string of characters, the equals method will return true, as in this example:
String string1 = ""foo"";
String string2 = ""foo"";

// test for equality with the java string equals method
if (string1.equals(string2))
{
    // this line WILL print
    System.out.println(""The two strings are the same."")
}
Option 2: String comparison with the equalsIgnoreCase method
In some string comparison tests you'll want to ignore whether the strings are uppercase or lowercase. When you want to test your strings for equality in this case-insensitive manner, use the equalsIgnoreCase method of the String class, like this:
String string1 = ""foo"";
String string2 = ""FOO"";

 // java string compare while ignoring case
 if (string1.equalsIgnoreCase(string2))
 {
     // this line WILL print
     System.out.println(""Ignoring case, the two strings are the same."")
 }
Option 3: Java String comparison with the compareTo method
There is also a third, less common way to compare Java strings, and that's with the String class compareTo method. If the two strings are exactly the same, the compareTo method will return a value of 0 (zero). Here's a quick example of what this String comparison approach looks like:
String string1 = ""foo bar"";
String string2 = ""foo bar"";

// java string compare example
if (string1.compareTo(string2) == 0)
{
    // this line WILL print
    System.out.println(""The two strings are the same."")
}
While I'm writing about this concept of equality in Java, it's important to note that the Java language includes an equals method in the base Java Object class. Whenever you're creating your own objects and you want to provide a means to see if two instances of your object are ""equal"", you should override (and implement) this equals method in your class (in the same way the Java language provides this equality/comparison behavior in the String equals method).

This is why it is a bad idea to use regular string concatenation if you have a serious of amount of string processing to do. Instead you would use the StringBuilder classes provided.

As it said, you need to define the nature of your executing context where you are willing to await a task before anything.
Just put async before the fn declaration in which your async task will execute.
var start = async function(a, b) { 
  // Your async task will execute with await
  await foo()
  console.log('I will execute after foo get either resolved/rejected')
}
Explanation:
In your question, you are importing a method which is asynchronous in nature and will execute in parallel. But where you are trying to execute that async method is inside a different execution context which you need to define async to use await.

await consumes promise/future / task-returning methods/functions and async marks a method/function as capable of using await.
Also if you are familiar with promises, await is actually doing the same process of promise/resolve. Creating a chain of promise and executes your next task in resolve callback.

(If one range is neither completely after the other,
nor completely before the other, then they must overlap.)
Now one of De Morgan's laws says that:

NOTE: This includes conditions where the edges overlap exactly. If you wish to exclude that,
change the >= operators to >, and <= to <

DateRangesOverlap = max(start1, start2) < min(end1, end2)
This is actually a syntactical shortcut for what is a longer implementation, which includes extra checks to verify that the start dates are on or before the endDates. Deriving this from above:
If start and end dates can be out of order, i.e., if it is possible that startA > endA or startB > endB, then you also have to check that they are in order, so that means you have to add two additional validity rules:
(StartA <= EndB) and (StartB <= EndA) and (StartA <= EndA) and (StartB <= EndB) or:
(StartA <= EndB) and (StartA <= EndA) and (StartB <= EndA) and (StartB <= EndB) or,
(StartA <= Min(EndA, EndB) and (StartB <= Min(EndA, EndB)) or:
(Max(StartA, StartB) <= Min(EndA, EndB)

The short(ish) answer is: given two date intervals A and B with components .start and .end and the constraint .start <= .end, then two intervals overlap if:
A.end >= B.start AND A.start <= B.end
You can tune the use of >= vs > and <= vs < to meet your requirements for degree of overlap.
ErikE comments:
You can only get 13 if you count things funny... I can get ""15 possible relations that two intervals can have"" when I go crazy with it. By sensible counting, I get only six, and if you throw out caring whether A or B comes first, I get only three (no intersect, partially intersect, one wholly within other). 15 goes like this: [before:before, start, within, end, after], [start:start, within, end, after], [within:within, end, after], [end:end, after], [after:after].
I think that you cannot count the two entries 'before:before' and 'after:after'. I could see 7 entries if you equate some relations with their inverses (see the diagram in the referenced Wikipedia URL; it has 7 entries, 6 of which have a different inverse, with equals not having a distinct inverse). And whether three is sensible depends on your requirements.

630,325933,paxdiablo,14860,"All the solutions that check a multitude of conditions based on where the ranges are in relation to one another can be greatly simplified by simply ensuring that one range starts before or at the same time as the other. You can do this by swapping the ranges if necessary up front.
Then, you can detect overlap if the second range start is:
less than or equal to the first range end (if ranges are inclusive, containing both the start and end times); or
less than (if ranges are inclusive of start and exclusive of end).
For example (assuming inclusive at both ends), there's only four possibilities for range 2, of which one is a non-overlap (the > at the end of the range means it doesn't matter where the range ends):
|-----|        range 1, lines below are all range 2.
|-->  :        overlap.
 |--> :        overlap.
      |--->    overlap (no overlap in exclusive-of-end case).
       |--->   no overlap.
The endpoint of the second range doesn't affect the result at all. So, in pseudo-code, you can do something like (assuming s <= e holds for all ranges - if not, you may have top swap them as well):
def overlaps(r1, r2):
    if r1.s > r2.s:
        swap r1, r2
    return r2.s <= r1.e
Or, the one-level-limit recursive option:
def overlaps(r1, r2):
    if r1.s <= r2.s:
        return r2.s <= r1.e
    return overlaps(r2, r1)
If the ranges are exclusive at the end, you just have to replace <= with < in the expression you return (in both code snippets).
This greatly limits the number of checks you have to make because you remove half of the problem space early by ensuring the first range never starts after the second.
And, since ""code talks"", here is some Python code that shows this in action, with quite a few test cases. First, the InclusiveRange class:
class InclusiveRange:
    """"""InclusiveRange class to represent a lower and upper bound.""""""

    def __init__(self, start, end):
        """"""Initialisation, ensures start <= end.
        Args:
            start: The start of the range.
            end: The end of the range.
        """"""
        self.start = min(start, end)
        self.end = max(start, end)

    def __repr__(self):
        """"""Return representation for f-string.""""""
        return f""({self.start}, {self.end})""

    def overlaps(self, other):
        """"""True if range overlaps with another.
        Args:
            other: The other InclusiveRange to check against.
        """"""

        # Very limited recursion to ensure start of first range
        # isn't after start of second.

        if self.start > other.start:
            return other.overlaps(self)

        # Greatly simplified check for overlap.

        return other.start <= self.end
Then a test case handler to allow us to nicely present the result of a single test case:
def test_case(range1, range2):
    """"""Single test case checker.""""""

    # Get low and high value for ""graphic"" output.

    low = min(range1.start, range2.start)
    high = max(range1.end, range2.end)

    # Output ranges and graphic.

    print(f""r1={range1} r2={range2}: "", end="""")
    for val in range(low, high + 1):
        is_in_first = range1.start <= val <= range1.end
        is_in_second = range2.start <= val <= range2.end

        if is_in_first and is_in_second:
            print(""|"", end="""")
        elif is_in_first:
            print(""'"", end="""")
        elif is_in_second:
            print("","", end="""")
        else:
            print("" "", end="""")

    # Finally, output result of overlap check.

    print(f"" - {range1.overlaps(range2)}\n"")
Then finally, a decent chunk of test cases to which you can add your own if need be:
# Various test cases, add others if you doubt the correctness.

test_case(InclusiveRange(0, 1), InclusiveRange(8, 9))
test_case(InclusiveRange(0, 4), InclusiveRange(5, 9))
test_case(InclusiveRange(0, 4), InclusiveRange(4, 9))
test_case(InclusiveRange(0, 7), InclusiveRange(2, 9))
test_case(InclusiveRange(0, 4), InclusiveRange(0, 9))
test_case(InclusiveRange(0, 9), InclusiveRange(0, 9))

The simplest way is to use a well-engineered dedicated library for date-time work.
someInterval.overlaps( anotherInterval )
java.time & ThreeTen-Extra
The best in the business is the java.time framework built into Java 8 and later. Add to that the ThreeTen-Extra project that supplements java.time with additional classes, specifically the Interval class we need here.
As for the language-agnostic tag on this Question, the source code for both projects is available for use in other languages (mind their licenses).
Interval
The org.threeten.extra.Interval class is handy, but requires date-time moments (java.time.Instant objects) rather than date-only values. So we proceed by using the first moment of the day in UTC to represent the date.
Instant start = Instant.parse( ""2016-01-01T00:00:00Z"" );
Instant stop = Instant.parse( ""2016-02-01T00:00:00Z"" );
Create an Interval to represent that span of time.
Interval interval_A = Interval.of( start , stop );
We can also define an Interval with a starting moment plus a Duration.
Instant start_B = Instant.parse( ""2016-01-03T00:00:00Z"" );
Interval interval_B = Interval.of( start_B , Duration.of( 3 , ChronoUnit.DAYS ) );
Comparing to test for overlaps is easy.
Boolean overlaps = interval_A.overlaps( interval_B );
You can compare an Interval against another Interval or Instant:
abuts
contains
encloses
equals
isAfter
isBefore
overlaps

643,325933,Meno Hochschild,2491410,"The mathematical solution given by @Bretana is good but neglects two specific details:
aspect of closed or half-open intervals
empty intervals
About the closed or open state of interval boundaries, the solution of @Bretana valid for closed intervals
(StartA <= EndB) and (EndA >= StartB)
can be rewritten for half-open intervals to:
(StartA < EndB) and (EndA > StartB)
This correction is necessary because an open interval boundary does not belong to the value range of an interval by definition.
And about empty intervals, well, here the relationship shown above does NOT hold. Empty intervals which do not contain any valid value by definition must be handled as special case. I demonstrate it by my Java time library Time4J via this example:
MomentInterval a = MomentInterval.between(Instant.now(), Instant.now().plusSeconds(2));
MomentInterval b = a.collapse(); // make b an empty interval out of a

System.out.println(a); // [2017-04-10T05:28:11,909000000Z/2017-04-10T05:28:13,909000000Z)
System.out.println(b); // [2017-04-10T05:28:11,909000000Z/2017-04-10T05:28:11,909000000Z)
The leading square bracket ""["" indicates a closed start while the last bracket "")"" indicates an open end.
System.out.println(
      ""startA < endB: "" + a.getStartAsInstant().isBefore(b.getEndAsInstant())); // false
System.out.println(
      ""endA > startB: "" + a.getEndAsInstant().isAfter(b.getStartAsInstant())); // true

System.out.println(""a overlaps b: "" + a.intersects(b)); // a overlaps b: false
As shown above, empty intervals violate the overlap condition above (especially startA < endB), so Time4J (and other libraries, too) has to handle it as special edge case in order to guarantee that the overlap of any arbitrary interval with an empty interval does not exist. Of course, date intervals (which are closed by default in Time4J but can be half-open, too, like empty date intervals) are handled in a similar way.",2017-04-10 05:56:52Z,3

645,325933,Will,464923,"In case you're using a date range that has not ended yet (still on going) e.g. not set endDate = '0000-00-00' you can not use BETWEEN because 0000-00-00 is not a valid date!
I used this solution:
(Startdate BETWEEN '"".$startdate2.""' AND '"".$enddate2.""')  //overlap: starts between start2/end2
OR (Startdate < '"".$startdate2.""' 
  AND (enddate = '0000-00-00' OR enddate >= '"".$startdate2.""')

The first one is most reliable, and easy but seems not that fancy as you want: https://market.strapi.io/plugins/strapi-plugin-slugify
The main reason to use this solution is that it handles slug creation when you create post via REST api. The uuid field needs extra work when post created not from admin panel.
So second option is do it yourself style: /api/article/controller/article.js
module.exports = createCoreController('api::article.article', ({strapi}) => ({
   findOne(ctx){
      const { slug } = ctx.params;
      return strapi.db.query('api::article.article').findOne({where: {slug});
   }
});
then in the routes create routes.js file /api/article/routes/routes.js
module.exports = {
  routes: [
     {
       method: 'GET',
       path: '/articles/:slug'
       handler: 'article.findOne'
     }
  ]
}
then if you want to create articles for outside of admin, create lifecycles.js in /api/article/content-types/article/lifecycles.js
module.exports = {
  async beforeCreate(event) {
     // here you have to do something like
     let slug = slugify(event.result.name);
     let isNotFree = await strapi.db.query(""api::article.article"").findOne({where: {slug}});

     if (Boolean(!isNotFree)) // < not sure prolly need an empty object check 
       for (let i = i; i < 9999 ; i++) {
       slug = `${slug}-${i}`;
       isNotFree = await strapi.db.query(""api::article.article"").findOne({where: {slug}});
       if (Boolean(!isNotFree))
           break;
     }
     event.result.slug = slug
  }
}
pleas note the lifecycle code is just a first thing came to my mind, should be tested and optimized prolly

A container only runs one process, though; if you need two separate processes from the same code base then you can run two separate containers off the same image, overriding the command: on one of them.
So reduce the Dockerfile to copy the code base in, and declare one process or the other as the main container command:

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY ./ ./

Run code snippetExpand snippet

Each row is given a left property using nth-child
Each column is given a top property using a nth-child trick to get only first 4n elements (where subsequent grabs overwrite the top)
This means all elements have both left and top set which means transition can be used on hover
This doesn't use the grid layout which means it's harder to expand or interact with this grid
There is no way (which I know) to selectivly turn on and off pointer-events on hover on and off which means you must hover off to select a different item.

This uses JS to capture the mouse and add the focus class to whichever element should be focused which is then expanded using combined css and javascript transforming
This uses the grid layout which makes it easily scalable and customizable unlike CSS only.
Unlike CSS only, all elements shift around as no absolute positioning is being used which may not be preferable
The perfect solution
The perfect solution would be to create elements with JS and keep everything in JS, which, although incredibly time consuming would work perfectly",2022-11-26 18:30:42Z,3

no VLAs (I heard they are the devil and to always avoid them and not to talk to people who suggest using them in any scenario.
VLAs are a problem if you want your code to work with Microsoft's stunted C compiler, as MS has steadfastly refused to implement VLA support, even when C99, in which VLA support was mandatory, was the current language standard. Generally speaking, I would suggest avoiding Microsoft's C compiler altogether if you can, but I will stop well short of suggesting the avoidance of people who advise you differently.
VLAs are also a potential problem when you declare an automatic object of VLA type, without managing the maximum dimension. Especially so when the dimension comes from user input. This produces a risk of program crash that is hard to test or mitigate at development time, except by avoiding the situation in the first place.
But it is at best overly dramatic to call VLAs ""the devil"", and I propose that anyone who actually told you ""not to talk to people who suggest using them in any scenario"" must not have trusted you to understand the issues involved or to evaluate them for yourself. In particular, pointers to VLAs are a fine way to address all your points besides ""no VLAs"", and they have no particular technical issues other than lack of support by (mostly) Microsoft. Support for these will be mandatory again in C2X, the next C language specification, though support for some other forms of VLA use will remain optional.
Your requirements
If any of the dimensions of an array type are not given by integer constant expressions, then that type is by definition a variable-length array type. If any dimension but the first of an array type is not given by an integer constant expressions then you cannot express the corresponding pointer type without using a VLA.
Therefore, if you want a contiguously allocated multidimensional array (array of arrays) for which any dimension other than the first is chosen at runtime, then a VLA type must be involved. Allocating such an object dynamically works great and has little or no downside other than lack of support by certain compilers (which is a non-negligible consideration, to be sure). It would look something like this:
void do_something(size_t rows, size_t columns) {
    int (*my_array)[columns];  // pointer to VLA

    my_array = malloc(rows * sizeof(*my_array));

    // ... access elements as my_array[row][col] ...
}
You should have seen similar in some of the Q&As you reference in the question.
If that's not acceptable, then you need to choose which of your other requirements to give up. I would suggest the ""multi-dimensional"" part. Instead, allocate (effectively) a one-dimensional array, and use it as if it had two dimensions by performing appropriate index computations upon access. This should perform almost as well, because it's pretty close to what the compiler will set up automatically for a multidimensional array. You can make it a bit easier on yourself by creating a macro to assist with the computations. For example,
#define ELEMENT_2D(a, dim2, row, col) ((a)[(row) * (dim2) + (col)])

void do_something(size_t rows, size_t columns) {
    int *my_array;

    my_array = malloc(rows * columns * sizeof(*my_array));

    // ... access elements as ELEMENT_2D(my_array, columns, row, col) ..
}
Alternatively, you could give up the contiguous allocation and go with an array of pointers instead. This is what people who don't understand arrays, pointers, and / or dynamic allocation typically do, and although there are some applications, especially for arrays of pointers to strings, this form has mostly downside relative to contiguous allocation for the kinds of applications where one wants an object they think of as a 2D array.",2022-11-27 13:53:55Z,4
685,74584190,John Bode,134554,"You can dynamically allocate a contiguous 2D array as
int (*arr)[cols] = malloc( rows * sizeof (int [cols]) );
and then access elements as arr[i][j].
If your compiler doesn’t support VLAs, then cols will have to be a constant expression.",2022-11-26 17:51:40Z,3
686,74584190,Jonathan Leffler,15168,"Suppose you need a 2D array of size W x H containing ints (where H is the number of rows, and W the number of columns).
Then you can do the the following:
Allocation:
int * a = malloc(W * H * sizeof(int));
Access element at location (i,j):
int val = a[j * W + i];
a[j * W + i] = val;
The whole array would occupy a continuous block of memory, and can be dynamically allocated (without VLAs). Being a continuous block of memory offers an advantage over an array of pointers due to [potentially] fewer cache misses.
In such an array, the term ""stride"" refers to the offset between one row to another. If you need to use padding e.g. to make sure all lines start at some aligned address, you can use a stride which is bigger than W.",2022-11-26 19:15:57Z,1

692,74584180,rodrigo,865874,"If you look at the documentation of trim() you'll notice that it's not a member of String but of str:
pub fn trim(&self) -> &str
That is, it takes a &str (string slice) and returns another &str, a subslice, with the same lifetime.
Now, your code is equivalent of doing something like:
let s: &str = String::from("" hello "").trim();
That would create a temporary String, borrow it as a &str, and compute its trim slice. Then the temporary is dropped and the trimmed slice reference is invalidated. Fortunately Rust lifetime rules prevents you from trying to use that invalid value.
If you save a temporary value in a variable you avoid dropping it, as you noticed in your code.
let s: String = String::from("" hello "");
let s: &str = s.trim();
And now the code does what you want.
If you do not need to ever use the temporary it is idiomatic in Rust to use the same name for both values, to illustrate that point, and to avoid having to think of two names (naming things is hard). Note that the first s still exists, it is not destroyed by having another variable with the same name, it is just shadowed, and it will be dropped normally at the end of its scope.",2022-11-26 17:42:06Z,2

   pub fn dfs_parent_child(self) ...
   pub fn get_leaves(self) ...
To not consume the I3Info, allowing it to be used more than once, declare your methods to take references to the I3Info:
   pub fn dfs_parent_child(&self) ...
   pub fn get_leaves(&self) ...
You will need to modify the code within these methods, also, to work with references because this change also means you can no longer move things out of self — they have to be left intact. Sometimes this is as simple as putting & before a field access (&self.foo instead of self.foo), and sometimes it will require more extensive changes.
The general “Rust way of thinking” lessons here are:
Think about the type of your method receivers. self is not always right, and neither is &self.
Don't take ownership of values except when it makes sense. Passing by & reference is a good default choice (except for Copy types, like numbers).",2022-11-26 19:01:05Z,2

766,12769982,"16 revs, 9 users 68%",12770075,"Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent
Happens when your script tries to send an HTTP header to the client but there already was output before, which resulted in headers to be already sent to the client.
This is an E_WARNING and it will not stop the script.
A typical example would be a template file like this:
<html>
    <?php session_start(); ?>
    <head><title>My Page</title>
</html>
...
The session_start() function will try to send headers with the session cookie to the client. But PHP already sent headers when it wrote the <html> element to the output stream. You'd have to move the session_start() to the top.
You can solve this by going through the lines before the code triggering the Warning and check where it outputs. Move any header sending code before that code.
An often overlooked output is new lines after PHP's closing ?>. It is considered a standard practice to omit ?> when it is the last thing in the file. Likewise, another common cause for this warning is when the opening <?php has an empty space, line, or invisible character before it, causing the web server to send the headers and the whitespace/newline thus when PHP starts parsing won't be able to submit any header.
If your file has more than one <?php ... ?> code block in it, you should not have any spaces in between them. (Note: You might have multiple blocks if you had code that was automatically constructed)
Also make sure you don't have any Byte Order Marks in your code, for example when the encoding of the script is UTF-8 with BOM.

Happens with code similar to xyz->method() where xyz is not an object and therefore that method can not be called.
This is a fatal error which will stop the script (forward compatibility notice: It will become a catchable error starting with PHP 7).
Most often this is a sign that the code has missing checks for error conditions. Validate that an object is actually an object before calling its methods.

// ... some code using PDO
$statement = $pdo->prepare('invalid query', ...);
$statement->execute(...);
In the example above, the query cannot be prepared and prepare() will assign false to $statement. Trying to call the execute() method will then result in the Fatal Error because false is a ""non-object"" because the value is a boolean.
Figure out why your function returned a boolean instead of an object. For example, check the $pdo object for the last error that occurred. Details on how to debug this will depend on how errors are handled for the particular function/object/class in question.
If even the ->prepare is failing then your $pdo database handle object didn't get passed into the current scope. Find where it got defined. Then pass it as a parameter, store it as property, or share it via the global scope.
Another problem may be conditionally creating an object and then trying to call a method outside that conditional block. For example
if ($someCondition) {
    $myObj = new MyObj();
}
// ...
$myObj->someMethod();
By attempting to execute the method outside the conditional block, your object may not be defined.

Also known as the White Page Of Death or White Screen Of Death. This happens when error reporting is turned off and a fatal error (often syntax error) occurred.
If you have error logging enabled, you will find the concrete error message in your error log. This will usually be in a file called ""php_errors.log"", either in a central location (e.g. /var/log/apache2 on many Linux environments) or in the directory of the script itself (sometimes used in a shared hosting environment).
Sometimes it might be more straightforward to temporarily enable the display of errors. The white page will then display the error message. Take care because these errors are visible to everybody visiting the website.
This can be easily done by adding at the top of the script the following PHP code:
ini_set('display_errors', 1); error_reporting(~0);
The code will turn on the display of errors and set reporting to the highest level.
Since the ini_set() is executed at runtime it has no effects on parsing/syntax errors. Those errors will appear in the log. If you want to display them in the output as well (e.g. in a browser) you have to set the display_startup_errors directive to true. Do this either in the php.ini or in a .htaccess or by any other method that affects the configuration before runtime.
You can use the same methods to set the log_errors and error_log directives to choose your own log file location.
Looking in the log or using the display, you will get a much better error message and the line of code where your script comes to halt.

Happens when you try to access an array by a key that does not exist in the array.
A typical example of an Undefined Index notice would be (demo)
$data = array('foo' => '42', 'bar');
echo $data['spinach'];
echo $data[1];
Both spinach and 1 do not exist in the array, causing an E_NOTICE to be triggered. In PHP 8.0, this is an E_WARNING instead.
The solution is to make sure the index or offset exists prior to accessing that index. This may mean that you need to fix a bug in your program to ensure that those indexes do exist when you expect them to. Or it may mean that you need to test whether the indexes exist using array_key_exists or isset:
$data = array('foo' => '42', 'bar');
if (array_key_exists('spinach', $data)) {
    echo $data['spinach'];
}
else {
    echo 'No key spinach in the array';
}
If you have code like:
<?php echo $_POST['message']; ?>
<form method=""post"" action="""">
    <input type=""text"" name=""message"">
    ...
then $_POST['message'] will not be set when this page is first loaded and you will get the above error. Only when the form is submitted and this code is run a second time will the array index exist. You typically check for this with:
if ($_POST)  ..  // if the $_POST array is not empty
// or
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') ..  // page was requested with POST

$this is a special variable in PHP which can not be assigned. If it is accessed in a context where it does not exist, this fatal error is given.
This error can occur:
If a non-static method is called statically. Example:
class Foo {
   protected $var;
   public function __construct($var) {
       $this->var = $var;
   }

   public static function bar () {

   }

Foo::bar();
How to fix: review your code again, $this can only be used in an object context, and should never be used in a static method. Also, a static method should not access the non-static property. Use self::$static_property to access the static property.
If code from a class method has been copied over into a normal function or just the global scope and keeping the $this special variable.
How to fix: Review the code and replace $this with a different substitution variable.

772,12769982,"8 revs, 5 users 88%",12784048,"Fatal error: Call to undefined function XXX
Happens when you try to call a function that is not defined yet. Common causes include missing extensions and includes, conditional function declaration, function in a function declaration or simple typos.
Example 1 - Conditional Function Declaration
$someCondition = false;
if ($someCondition === true) {
    function fn() {
        return 1;
    }
}
echo fn(); // triggers error
In this case, fn() will never be declared because $someCondition is not true.
Example 2 - Function in Function Declaration
function createFn() 
{
    function fn() {
        return 1;
    }
}
echo fn(); // triggers error
In this case, fn will only be declared once createFn() gets called. Note that subsequent calls to createFn() will trigger an error about Redeclaration of an Existing function.
You may also see this for a PHP built-in function. Try searching for the function in the official manual, and check what ""extension"" (PHP module) it belongs to, and what versions of PHP support it.
In case of a missing extension, install that extension and enable it in php.ini. Refer to the Installation Instructions in the PHP Manual for the extension your function appears in. You may also be able to enable or install the extension using your package manager (e.g. apt in Debian or Ubuntu, yum in Red Hat or CentOS), or a control panel in a shared hosting environment.
If the function was introduced in a newer version of PHP from what you are using, you may find links to alternative implementations in the manual or its comment section. If it has been removed from PHP, look for information about why, as it may no longer be necessary.
In case of missing includes, make sure to include the file declaring the function before calling the function.
In case of typos, fix the typo.

This usually happens when using a function directly with empty.
Example:
if (empty(is_null(null))) {
  echo 'empty';
}
This is because empty is a language construct and not a function, it cannot be called with an expression as its argument in PHP versions before 5.5. Prior to PHP 5.5, the argument to empty() must be a variable, but an arbitrary expression (such as a return value of a function) is permissible in PHP 5.5+.
empty, despite its name, does not actually check if a variable is ""empty"". Instead, it checks if a variable doesn't exist, or == false. Expressions (like is_null(null) in the example) will always be deemed to exist, so here empty is only checking if it is equal to false. You could replace empty() here with !, e.g. if (!is_null(null)), or explicitly compare to false, e.g. if (is_null(null) == false).

This error is often caused because you forgot to properly escape the data passed to a MySQL query.
An example of what not to do (the ""Bad Idea""):
$query = ""UPDATE `posts` SET my_text='{$_POST['text']}' WHERE id={$_GET['id']}"";
mysqli_query($db, $query);
This code could be included in a page with a form to submit, with an URL such as http://example.com/edit.php?id=10 (to edit the post n°10)
What will happen if the submitted text contains single quotes? $query will end up with:
$query = ""UPDATE `posts` SET my_text='I'm a PHP newbie' WHERE id=10';
And when this query is sent to MySQL, it will complain that the syntax is wrong, because there is an extra single quote in the middle.
To avoid such errors, you MUST always escape the data before use in a query.
Escaping data before use in a SQL query is also very important because if you don't, your script will be open to SQL injections. An SQL injection may cause alteration, loss or modification of a record, a table or an entire database. This is a very serious security issue!

In PHP 8.0 and above, the message is instead:

This error is most often encountered when attempting to reference an array value with a quoted key for interpolation inside a double-quoted string when the entire complex variable construct is not enclosed in {}.
The error case:
This will result in Unexpected T_ENCAPSED_AND_WHITESPACE:
echo ""This is a double-quoted string with a quoted array key in $array['key']"";
//---------------------------------------------------------------------^^^^^
Possible fixes:
In a double-quoted string, PHP will permit array key strings to be used unquoted, and will not issue an E_NOTICE. So the above could be written as:
echo ""This is a double-quoted string with an un-quoted array key in $array[key]"";
//------------------------------------------------------------------------^^^^^
The entire complex array variable and key(s) can be enclosed in {}, in which case they should be quoted to avoid an E_NOTICE. The PHP documentation recommends this syntax for complex variables.
echo ""This is a double-quoted string with a quoted array key in {$array['key']}"";
//--------------------------------------------------------------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
// Or a complex array property of an object:
echo ""This is a a double-quoted string with a complex {$object->property->array['key']}"";
Of course, the alternative to any of the above is to concatenate the array variable in instead of interpolating it:
echo ""This is a double-quoted string with an array variable"". $array['key'] . "" concatenated inside."";

777,12769982,"8 revs, 5 users 55%",12770179,"Fatal error: Allowed memory size of XXX bytes exhausted (tried to allocate XXX bytes)
There is not enough memory to run your script. PHP has reached the memory limit and stops executing it. This error is fatal, the script stops. The value of the memory limit can be configured either in the php.ini file or by using ini_set('memory_limit', '128 M'); in the script (which will overwrite the value defined in php.ini). The purpose of the memory limit is to prevent a single PHP script from gobbling up all the available memory and bringing the whole web server down.
The first thing to do is to minimise the amount of memory your script needs. For instance, if you're reading a large file into a variable or are fetching many records from a database and are storing them all in an array, that may use a lot of memory. Change your code to instead read the file line by line or fetch database records one at a time without storing them all in memory. This does require a bit of a conceptual awareness of what's going on behind the scenes and when data is stored in memory vs. elsewhere.
If this error occurred when your script was not doing memory-intensive work, you need to check your code to see whether there is a memory leak. The memory_get_usage function is your friend.

I can't seem to find where my code has gone wrong. Here is my full error:
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_VARIABLE on line x
What I am trying

Answer
Parse error: A problem with the syntax of your program, such as leaving a semicolon off of the end of a statement or, like the case above, missing the . operator. The interpreter stops running your program when it encounters a parse error.
In simple words this is a syntax error, meaning that there is something in your code stopping it from being parsed correctly and therefore running.
What you should do is check carefully at the lines around where the error is for any simple mistakes.
That error message means that in line x of the file, the PHP interpreter was expecting to see an open parenthesis but instead, it encountered something called T_VARIABLE. That T_VARIABLE thing is called a token. It's the PHP interpreter's way of expressing different fundamental parts of programs. When the interpreter reads in a program, it translates what you've written into a list of tokens. Wherever you put a variable in your program, there is aT_VARIABLE token in the interpreter's list.
Good read: List of Parser Tokens
So make sure you enable at least E_PARSE in your php.ini. Parse errors should not exist in production scripts.
I always recommended to add the following statement, while coding:
error_reporting(E_ALL);
PHP error reporting
Also, a good idea to use an IDE which will let you know parse errors while typing. You can use:
NetBeans (a fine piece of beauty, free software) (the best in my opinion)
PhpStorm (uncle Gordon love this: P, paid plan, contains proprietary and free software)
Eclipse (beauty and the beast, free software)

785,12769982,"4 revs, 3 users 94%",26572398,"Notice: Trying to get property of non-object error
Happens when you try to access a property of an object while there is no object.
A typical example for a non-object notice would be
$users = json_decode('[{""name"": ""hakre""}]');
echo $users->name; # Notice: Trying to get property of non-object
In this case, $users is an array (so not an object) and it does not have any properties.
This is similar to accessing a non-existing index or key of an array (see Notice: Undefined Index).
This example is much simplified. Most often such a notice signals an unchecked return value, e.g. when a library returns NULL if an object does not exists or just an unexpected non-object value (e.g. in an Xpath result, JSON structures with unexpected format, XML with unexpected format etc.) but the code does not check for such a condition.
As those non-objects are often processed further on, often a fatal-error happens next on calling an object method on a non-object (see: Fatal error: Call to a member function ... on a non-object) halting the script.
It can be easily prevented by checking for error conditions and/or that a variable matches an expectation. Here such a notice with a DOMXPath example:
$result  = $xpath->query(""//*[@id='detail-sections']/div[1]"");
$divText = $result->item(0)->nodeValue; # Notice: Trying to get property of non-object
The problem is accessing the nodeValue property (field) of the first item while it has not been checked if it exists or not in the $result collection. Instead it pays to make the code more explicit by assigning variables to the objects the code operates on:
$result  = $xpath->query(""//*[@id='detail-sections']/div[1]"");
$div     = $result->item(0);
$divText = ""-/-"";
if (is_object($div)) {
    $divText = $div->nodeValue;

Resources are a type in PHP (like strings, integers or objects). A resource is an opaque blob with no inherently meaningful value of its own. A resource is specific to and defined by a certain set of PHP functions or extension. For instance, the Mysql extension defines two resource types:
There are two resource types used in the MySQL module. The first one is the link identifier for a database connection, the second a resource which holds the result of a query.
The cURL extension defines another two resource types:
... a cURL handle and a cURL multi handle.
When var_dumped, the values look like this:
$resource = curl_init();
var_dump($resource);

resource(1) of type (curl)
That's all most resources are, a numeric identifier ((1)) of a certain type ((curl)).
You carry these resources around and pass them to different functions for which such a resource means something. Typically these functions allocate certain data in the background and a resource is just a reference which they use to keep track of this data internally.
The ""... expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given"" error is typically the result of an unchecked operation that was supposed to create a resource, but returned false instead. For instance, the fopen function has this description:
Return Values
Returns a file pointer resource on success, or FALSE on error.
So in this code, $fp will either be a resource(x) of type (stream) or false:
$fp = fopen(...);
If you do not check whether the fopen operation succeed or failed and hence whether $fp is a valid resource or false and pass $fp to another function which expects a resource, you may get the above error:
$fp   = fopen(...);
$data = fread($fp, 1024);

Warning: fread() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given
You always need to error check the return value of functions which are trying to allocate a resource and may fail:
$fp = fopen(...);

if (!$fp) {
    trigger_error('Failed to allocate resource');
    exit;
}

$data = fread($fp, 1024);

If you see no result from your PHP code whatsoever and/or you are seeing parts of your literal PHP source code output in the webpage, you can be pretty sure that your PHP isn't actually getting executed. If you use View Source in your browser, you're probably seeing the whole PHP source code file as is. Since PHP code is embedded in <?php ?> tags, the browser will try to interpret those as HTML tags and the result may look somewhat confused.
To actually run your PHP scripts, you need:
a web server which executes your script
to set the file extension to .php, otherwise the web server won't interpret it as such*
to access your .php file via the web server
* Unless you reconfigure it, everything can be configured.
This last one is particularly important. Just double clicking the file will likely open it in your browser using an address such as:
file://C:/path/to/my/file.php
This is completely bypassing any web server you may have running and the file is not getting interpreted. You need to visit the URL of the file on your web server, likely something like:
http://localhost/my/file.php
You may also want to check whether you're using short open tags <? instead of <?php and your PHP configuration has turned short open tags off.

This simply happens if you try to treat an array as a string:

echo $arr;  // Notice: Array to string conversion
$str = 'Something, ' . $arr;  // Notice: Array to string conversion
An array cannot simply be echo'd or concatenated with a string, because the result is not well defined. PHP will use the string ""Array"" in place of the array, and trigger the notice to point out that that's probably not what was intended and that you should be checking your code here. You probably want something like this instead:
echo $arr[0];  // displays foo
$str = 'Something ' . join(', ', $arr); //displays Something, foo, bar
Or loop the array:
foreach($arr as $key => $value) {
    echo ""array $key = $value"";
    // displays first: array 0 = foo
    // displays next:  array 1 = bar

792,12769982,4 revs,32681786,"Warning: mysql_connect(): Access denied for user 'name'@'host'
This warning shows up when you connect to a MySQL/MariaDB server with invalid or missing credentials (username/password). So this is typically not a code problem, but a server configuration issue.
See the manual page on mysql_connect(""localhost"", ""user"", ""pw"") for examples.
Check that you actually used a $username and $password.
It's uncommon that you gain access using no password - which is what happened when the Warning: said (using password: NO).
Only the local test server usually allows to connect with username root, no password, and the test database name.
You can test if they're really correct using the command line client:
mysql --user=""username"" --password=""password"" testdb
Username and password are case-sensitive and whitespace is not ignored. If your password contains meta characters like $, escape them, or put the password in single quotes.
Most shared hosting providers predeclare mysql accounts in relation to the unix user account (sometimes just prefixes or extra numeric suffixes). See the docs for a pattern or documentation, and CPanel or whatever interface for setting a password.
See the MySQL manual on Adding user accounts using the command line. When connected as admin user you can issue a query like:
CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'newpassword';
Or use Adminer or WorkBench or any other graphical tool to create, check or correct account details.
If you can't fix your credentials, then asking the internet to ""please help"" will have no effect. Only you and your hosting provider have permissions and sufficient access to diagnose and fix things.
Verify that you could reach the database server, using the host name given by your provider:
ping dbserver.hoster.example.net
Check this from a SSH console directly on your webserver. Testing from your local development client to your shared hosting server is rarely meaningful.
Often you just want the server name to be ""localhost"", which normally utilizes a local named socket when available. Othertimes you can try ""127.0.0.1"" as fallback.
Should your MySQL/MariaDB server listen on a different port, then use ""servername:3306"".
If that fails, then there's a perhaps a firewall issue. (Off-topic, not a programming question. No remote guess-helping possible.)
When using constants like e.g. DB_USER or DB_PASSWORD, check that they're actually defined.
If you get a ""Warning: Access defined for 'DB_USER'@'host'"" and a ""Notice: use of undefined constant 'DB_PASS'"", then that's your problem.
Verify that your e.g. xy/db-config.php was actually included and whatelse.
Check for correctly set GRANT permissions.
It's not sufficient to have a username+password pair.
Each MySQL/MariaDB account can have an attached set of permissions.
Those can restrict which databases you are allowed to connect to, from which client/server the connection may originate from, and which queries are permitted.
The ""Access denied"" warning thus may as well show up for mysql_query calls, if you don't have permissions to SELECT from a specific table, or INSERT/UPDATE, and more commonly DELETE anything.
You can adapt account permissions when connected per command line client using the admin account with a query like:
GRANT ALL ON yourdb.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
If the warning shows up first with Warning: mysql_query(): Access denied for user ''@'localhost' then you may have a php.ini-preconfigured account/password pair.
Check that mysql.default_user= and mysql.default_password= have meaningful values.
Oftentimes this is a provider-configuration. So contact their support for mismatches.
Find the documentation of your shared hosting provider:
e.g. HostGator, GoDaddy, 1and1, DigitalOcean, BlueHost, DreamHost, MediaTemple, ixWebhosting, lunarhosting, or just google yours´.
Else consult your webhosting provider through their support channels.
Note that you may also have depleted the available connection pool. You'll get access denied warnings for too many concurrent connections. (You have to investigate the setup. That's an off-topic server configuration issue, not a programming question.)
Your libmysql client version may not be compatible with the database server. Normally MySQL and MariaDB servers can be reached with PHPs compiled in driver. If you have a custom setup, or an outdated PHP version, and a much newer database server, or significantly outdated one - then the version mismatch may prevent connections. (No, you have to investigate yourself. Nobody can guess your setup).

794,12769982,"5 revs, 4 users 87%",21507314,"Warning: Division by zero
The warning message 'Division by zero' is one of the most commonly asked questions among new PHP developers. This error will not cause an exception, therefore, some developers will occasionally suppress the warning by adding the error suppression operator @ before the expression. For example:
$value = @(2 / 0);
But, like with any warning, the best approach would be to track down the cause of the warning and resolve it. The cause of the warning is going to come from any instance where you attempt to divide by 0, a variable equal to 0, or a variable which has not been assigned (because NULL == 0) because the result will be 'undefined'.
To correct this warning, you should rewrite your expression to check that the value is not 0, if it is, do something else. If the value is zero you either should not divide, or you should change the value to 1 and then divide so the division results in the equivalent of having divided only by the additional variable.
if ( $var1 == 0 ) { // check if var1 equals zero
    $var1 = 1; // var1 equaled zero so change var1 to equal one instead
    $var3 = ($var2 / $var1); // divide var1/var2 ie. 1/1
} else {
    $var3 = ($var2 / $var1); // if var1 does not equal zero, divide
}

Occurs when you try to call a non-static method on a class as it was static, and you also have the E_STRICT flag in your error_reporting() settings.
Example :
class HTML {
   public function br() {
      echo '<br>';
   }
}
HTML::br() or $html::br()
You can actually avoid this error by not adding E_STRICT to error_reporting(), eg
error_reporting(E_ALL & ~E_STRICT);
since as for PHP 5.4.0 and above, E_STRICT is included in E_ALL [ref]. But that is not adviceable. The solution is to define your intended static function as actual static :
public static function br() {
  echo '<br>';
}
or call the function conventionally :
$html = new HTML();
$html->br();

Now, why do we need to wrap pagedown::chrome_print inside a function to use the timeout argument and then wrap the whole function inside a parenthesis?
From the section 17.5 of Rmarkdown Cookbook, Customizing the knit button,
It is possible to control the behavior of the Knit button by providing the knit field within the YAML frontmatter of your document. The field takes a function with the main argument input (the path to the input Rmd document) and other arguments that are currently ignored.
If you store the code directly within YAML, you must wrap the entire function in parentheses. If the source code has multiple lines, you have to indent all lines (except the first line) by at least two spaces.",2022-11-26 17:49:52Z,0

811,74584012,cactustictacs,13598222,"The short version is you shouldn't do this, there are all kinds of complications (especially when you're trying to access the Fragment's Views).
It's even more complicated if the Fragment might not even be added to the UI at all! If it's not there, what value are you supposed to use? If you want to somehow create the Fragment just so it exists, and so you can read the value from its text box, then that's a sign the value really needs to be stored somewhere else, so you don't need the Fragment if you want to access it.
The easiest, recommended, and modern way to share data like this is with a ViewModel:
class MyViewModel : ViewModel() {
    // setting a default value here!
    var currentHour: Int = 0
}
class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    val model: MyViewModel by viewModels()

    fun onCreate(...) {
        ...
        onOffButton.setOnClickListener {
            // access the data in the ViewModel
            val currentHour = model.currentHour
        }
    }
}
class MyFragment : Fragment() {
    // using activityViewModels so we get the parent Activity's copy of the VM,
    // so we're all sharing the same object and seeing the same data
    val model: MyViewModel by activityViewModels()
    
    fun onViewCreated(...) {
        ...
        hoursPicker.setOnValueChangeListener { _, _, newValue ->
            // update the VM
            model.currentHour = newValue
        }
    }
}
So basically, you have this ViewModel object owned by the Activity and visible to its Fragments. The VM outlives all of those components, so you don't lose data while an Activity is being destroyed on rotation, or when a Fragment isn't added to the UI, etc.
The VM is the source of data, everything else just reads from it, or updates it when something changes (like when the Fragment updates the variable when its number picker's value changes). This way, the Activity doesn't need to go ""ask"" the Fragment for info - it's stored in a central location, in the VM
This is the most basic way to use a ViewModel - you can start using LiveData and Flow objects to make different UI components observe data and react to changes too. For example, your button in your Activity could change some enabled state in the VM, and the Fragment (if it's added) will see that change and can do things like make the number picker visible or invisible.
It's way easier to coordinate this stuff with a ViewModel, so if you don't already know how to use them, I'd recommend learning it!",2022-11-26 18:12:40Z,0

Anyway, what you asked for is a very common error in Javascript: it means that a variable called includes, or an object with includes property, for example:
response {
  data: {
    includes: string;
  }
}
is trying to be read in your code, but either it is a declared variable which has not been initialized, or, more probably, it should be a key of an object which is not actually included in it (or maybe the object itself is undefined).
In our example, it means that response.data has not includes property, or even response has no data property at all.
If this variable comes out of an http request, this happens quite often due to distraction (for example, when one writes response.includes instead of response.data.includes). In that case, you'd better print the former variable with console.log to see what's wrong.",2022-11-27 00:17:53Z,0

you can the drop a button in page 1, and when you click on it, it jumps to page2. This would not really be called ""linking"", but navagation to another page.
You can thus of course add a hyper-link in page one. or you can drop in a button, and with some code jump/navigate to that page2.aspx.
So, assuming I have page1.aspx, and page2.aspx, then you are free to drop in a button, say like this:
   <asp:Button ID=""Button1"" runat=""server"" Text=""Jump to page2.aspx""
     OnClick=""Button1_Click"" />
And code behind could be this:
Protected Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)

    Response.Redirect(""~/page2.aspx"")

End Sub
But, you don't have to use code behind, and you can say drop in a hyperlink control, and do this without code.
eg:
   <asp:HyperLink ID=""HyperLink1"" runat=""server""
   NavigateUrl=""~/About.aspx"">HyperLink</asp:HyperLink>
So, you can jump/navagate from a html page to a aspx page by using a hyperlink.
If this is a html page, then use a html control, not a asp.net one, and thus use:
<a href=""About.aspx"">About our site</a>
So, you can use a plain jane hyper link, and use one in a aspx page, or a html page",2022-11-26 17:25:18Z,0

863,74583911,zsolt,4223799,"I think you are mixing up volumes and bind mounts. https://docs.docker.com/storage/
VOLUME Dockerfile command: A volume with the VOLUME command in a Dockerfile is created into the docker area on the host that is /var/lib/docker/volumes/.
I don't think it is possible to run docker without it having access to this directory or it would be not advisable to restrict permission of docker to these directories, these are dockers own directories after all.
So postgres dockerfile has this command in dockerfile, for example: https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/blob/master/15/bullseye/Dockerfile
line 186: VOLUME /var/lib/postgresql/data
This means that the /var/lib/postgresql/data directory that is inside the postgres container will be a VOLUME that will be stored on the host somewhere in /var/lib/docker/volumes/somerandomhashorguid..... in a directory with a random name.
You can also create a volume like this with docker run:
docker run --name mypostgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -v /etc postgres:15.1
This way the /etc directory that is inside the container will be stored on the host in the /var/lib/docker/volumes/somerandomhashorguid.....
This volume solution is needed for containers that need extra IO, because the files of the containers (that are not in volumes) are stored in the writeable layer as per the docs: ""Writing into a container’s writable layer requires a storage driver to manage the filesystem. The storage driver provides a union filesystem, using the Linux kernel. This extra abstraction reduces performance as compared to using data volumes, which write directly to the host filesystem.""
So you could technically remove the VOLUME command from the postgres dockerfile and rebuild the image for yourself and use that image to create your postgres container but it would have lesser performance.
Bind mounts are the type of data storage solution that can be mounted to anywhere on the host filesystem. For example if you would run:
docker run --name mypostgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -v /tmp/mypostgresdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:15.1
(Take not of the -v flag here, there is a colon between the host and the container directory while previously in the volume version of this flag there was no host directory and no colon either.)
then you would have a directory created on your docker host machine /tmp/mypostgresdata and the directory of the container of /var/lib/postgresql/data would be mapped here instead of the docker volumes internal directory /var/lib/docker/volumes/somerandomhashorguid.....
My general rule of thumb would be to use volumes - as in /var/lib/docker/volumes/ - whenever you can and deviate only if really necessary. Bind mounts are not flexible enough to make an image/container portable and the writable container layer has less performance than docker volumes.
You can list docker volumes with docker volume ls but you will not see bind mounted directories here. For that you will need to do docker inspect containername",2022-11-26 21:23:12Z,1

875,74583892,MikeT,4744514,"Assuming that you want to preserve each app users workouts and workoutsetss that they have input then you would not want to overwrite them by using createFromAsset.
Rather I suspect that what you want to do is introduce a new workoutlist table that is populated with predefined/pre-existing rows in the workoutlist as per a database supplied as an asset. In this case you do not want to use the createFromAsset method (although you could potentially have a second database created from the asset, attach it to the original and then merge the data - this would be more complex than it need be).
You also have to consider how to handle new installs, in which case there will be no existing user input workouts and workoutsetss, in which case you could use createFromAsset method. However, you would not want any other user's workouts and workoutsetss rows.
Based upon this assumption perhaps consider this demo that introduces a new table (workoutlist) whose data is retrieved from an asset maintaining the original user data in the other tables (workout and workoutset) but for a new install of the App creates database from the asset.
the schema is made up so will very likely differ from yours but the principle applies.

This has been written to allow easy switching/running of the App with either version, simply two changes to run as old or new version of the App.
to run as version 1 DATABASE_VERSION (in MainActivity) is set to 1
AND the WorkoutSet class is commented out in the @Database annotation.
the Mirgration handles the copy of the data from the asset if the database already exists, otherwise for a new file then createFromAssets is used to copy the database from the asset.
MainActivity the activity code that does something with the database to ensure that it is opened/accessed
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    public static final String DATABASE_NAME = ""workout.db"";
    public static final int DATABASE_VERSION = 2;
    public static final String DATABASE_ASSET_NAME = ""testit.db""/*DATABASE_NAME*/ /* could be different */;

    AllDAO dao;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        wdb = WorkoutDatabase.getInstance(this);
        dao = wdb.getAllDAO();

        if (dao.getNumberOfWorkouts() < 1) addInitialData();
        //wdb.close(); // FORCE close so WAL is full checkpointed (i.e. no -wal or -shm)
    }

    private void addInitialData() {
        String prefix = String.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis()); // to differentiate devices
        dao.insert(new Workout(prefix + ""-W001""));
        dao.insert(new Workout(prefix + ""-W002""));
        dao.insert(new WorkoutSet(prefix + ""-WS001"",1));
        dao.insert(new WorkoutSet(prefix + ""-WS002"",2));
    }
}
note the wdb.close() is uncommented when creating the database to be loaded into the SQlite tool.
testit.db the SQLite database file as modified to introduce the new workoutList table. This first copied from a run of the App at Version 1 and then adding the new table (according SQL copied from the createAllTables method of WorkoutDataabase_Impl class in the generated java (aka the exact table as per Room's expectations)).
Note really the rows should be deleted as they are user specific. Instead -WRONG has been added to the end of the data (helps to prove the some points)
as above
The new table
Navicat was the SQLite tool used rather than DB Browser.
Run 1 running at version 1 to populate the database
DATABASE_VERSION = 1
@Database(entities = {Workout.class,WorkoutSet.class/*, WorkoutList.class*/ /*<<<<<<<<<< ADDED for V2 */}, exportSchema = false, version = MainActivity.DATABASE_VERSION)
i.e. the WorkoutList table has been excluded
App Inspection shows:-
and
Impotantly no WorkoutList table
Run 2 version 2 and introduction of new workoutlist table
DATABASE_VERSION = 2
@Database(entities = {Workout.class,WorkoutSet.class, WorkoutList.class /*<<<<<<<<<< ADDED for V2 */}, exportSchema = false, version = MainActivity.DATABASE_VERSION)
i.e. WorkoutList now introduced
App Inspection shows:-
old rows retained (they do not have -WRONG as per the asset)
old rows retained
the new table, populated as per the asset
Run 3 new install (after App uninstalled) at VERSION 2
as an be seen the incorrectly left in the assets rows exist (obviously you would delete the rows in real life but leaving them in shows that they are from the asset rather than generated by the code in the activity)
likewise
Conclusion
So the new install of the App correctly copies the asset database via createFromAsset whilst if migrating only the new data in the workoutlist table is copied from the asset.",2022-11-27 01:07:55Z,0

881,74583881,Dan Getz,3004881,"Your code is written to deal with wave files where sampwidth=1, but per your comment, the sampwidth of your file is 2. This means that your frame_bytes array is not an array of samples, it's an array of bytes in which every two bytes together form one sample. (And because nchannels is 1, there is one sample per frame, mono audio.) So when you changed the LSB of all the bytes, you were changing not only the LSB of each sample, but also a bit in the middle of it.
You should convert this to an array of samples, and then change the samples LSBs. You can use array for this:
import array

samples = array.array('h', frame_bytes)  # signed 16-bit
# ... modify the samples ...
frames_modified = samples.tobytes()
Of course, it would be best if your code checked beforehand if you're dealing with signed shorts (sampsize==2) or unsigned bytes (sampsize==1), and then handle them accordingly. You might do something like:
samples = array.array('h' if sampsize == 2 else 'B', frame_bytes)

you have two files one with 4 columns (time,x,y,z) and the other with 3 columns (x,y,z)
I further assume that those files have the same number of rows and the rows of the second file correspond also to the time of the first file
you want to animate the trajectories from both files with a label containing the time from the column 1 of the first file
Comments:
in order to find out the number of rows, you could use stats (check help stats). With this gnuplot-only and platform-independent, unlike your n = system(sprintf('cat %s | wc -l', filedata))
row index starts at 0, e.g. every ::0::j. But since you have a headerline this line will not be plotted because it is text data.
there is the plotting style with labels. With this you can plot the value from column 1 somewhere as label, here at x,y,z ... u (7):(10):(10) ....

Splice is mutating state directly, to prevent this, you can use spread operator to make a copy of array.

                return .init(self[start..<end])
            }
        )
    }
}
Usage:
struct UserModel: Codable {
    let userid: Int
    let nickname: String
}

let users = [
    (1,""a""),
    (2,""b""),
    (3,""c""),

userSplit[1][0].nickname  // ""e""
userSplit[1][1].nickname  // ""f""
userSplit[1][2].nickname  // ""g""
userSplit[1][3].nickname  // ""h""
userSplit[2][0].nickname  // ""i""
userSplit[2][1].nickname  // ""j""
edit/update:
If you don't want to duplicate the collection elements you can just iterate the original collection subsequences. Something like:
extension Collection {
    func unfoldSubSequences(limitedTo maxLength: Int) -> UnfoldSequence<SubSequence,Index> {
        sequence(state: startIndex) { start in
            guard start < endIndex else { return nil }
            let end = index(start, offsetBy: maxLength, limitedBy: endIndex) ?? endIndex
            defer { start = end }
            return self[start..<end]
        }
    }
    func subSequences(limitedTo maxLength: Int) -> [SubSequence] { .init(unfoldSubSequences(limitedTo: maxLength))
    }
}
Usage:
let subSequences = users.subSequences(limitedTo: 4)

subSequences[0][0].nickname  // ""a""
subSequences[0][1].nickname  // ""b""
subSequences[0][2].nickname  // ""c""
subSequences[0][3].nickname  // ""d""
subSequences[1][4].nickname  // ""e""
subSequences[1][5].nickname  // ""f""
subSequences[1][6].nickname  // ""g""
subSequences[1][7].nickname  // ""h""
subSequences[2][8].nickname  // ""i""
subSequences[2][9].nickname  // ""j""

for subsequence in subSequences {
    for user in subsequence {
        print(user)
    }
}
This will print
UserModel(userid: 1, nickname: ""a"")
UserModel(userid: 2, nickname: ""b"")
UserModel(userid: 3, nickname: ""c"")
UserModel(userid: 4, nickname: ""d"")
UserModel(userid: 5, nickname: ""e"")
UserModel(userid: 6, nickname: ""f"")
UserModel(userid: 7, nickname: ""g"")
UserModel(userid: 8, nickname: ""h"")
UserModel(userid: 9, nickname: ""i"")
UserModel(userid: 10, nickname: ""j"")
And to make it complete you can extend RangeReplaceableCollection as follow. This would work with Strings as well (Collection of Characters):
extension RangeReplaceableCollection {
    func groups(limitedTo maxLength: Int) -> [Self] {
        subSequences(limitedTo: maxLength).map(Self.init)
    }
}

990,11563638,VLAZ,3689450,"There are various methods to get an input textbox value directly (without wrapping the input element inside a form element):
Method 1
document.getElementById('textbox_id').value to get the value of desired box
For example
document.getElementById(""searchTxt"").value;
  Note: Method 2,3,4 and 6 returns a collection of elements, so use [whole_number] to get the desired occurrence. For the first element, use [0], for the second one use [1], and so on...
Method 2
Use document.getElementsByClassName('class_name')[whole_number].value which returns a Live HTMLCollection
For example
document.getElementsByClassName(""searchField"")[0].value; if this is the first textbox in your page.
Method 3
Use document.getElementsByTagName('tag_name')[whole_number].value which also returns a live HTMLCollection
For example
document.getElementsByTagName(""input"")[0].value;, if this is the first textbox in your page.
Method 4
document.getElementsByName('name')[whole_number].value which also >returns a live NodeList
For example
document.getElementsByName(""searchTxt"")[0].value; if this is the first textbox with name 'searchtext' in your page.
Method 5
Use the powerful document.querySelector('selector').value which uses a CSS selector to select the element
For example
document.querySelector('#searchTxt').value; selected by id
document.querySelector('.searchField').value; selected by class
document.querySelector('input').value; selected by tagname
document.querySelector('[name=""searchTxt""]').value; selected by name
Method 6
document.querySelectorAll('selector')[whole_number].value which also uses a CSS selector to select elements, but it returns all elements with that selector as a static Nodelist.
For example
document.querySelectorAll('#searchTxt')[0].value; selected by id
document.querySelectorAll('.searchField')[0].value; selected by class
document.querySelectorAll('input')[0].value; selected by tagname
document.querySelectorAll('[name=""searchTxt""]')[0].value; selected by name

For example, you can define guards like this:

def import_math():

import_math()
the above function will import the module math, but only in its local scope, anyone that tries to reference math outside of it will get a name error, because math is not defined in the global scope.
any module that is imported is saved into sys.modules so a call to check
import_math()
print(""math"" in sys.modules)
will print True, because sys.modules caches any module that is loaded anywhere, whether or not it was available in the global scope, a very simple way to define math in the global scope would then to
import_math()
math = sys.modules[""math""]
which will convert it from being only in sys.modules to being in the global scope, this is just equivalent to
import math
which defines a variable math in the global scope that points to the module math.
now if you want to see whether ""math"" exists in the global scope is to check if it is in the global scope directly.

Notice that you still have that lefternmost column with the index number, I did not clean it out because I wasn't sure of what you wanted there.
Also, importantly, you need to be aware that if there is a slight difference in the names of the columns in your files (e.g. impulsion specifique vs impulsion spécifique) this will bring errors. You will need to create error handling procedures for these. Or maybe enforcing a certain schema, but that is out of the scope of this question.

1113,74583505,Martijn Pieters,100297,"You can slice Python lists using a step (sometimes called a stride), you can use this to get every second element, starting at index 1 (for the first letter):
>>> example = ['30', 'M', '1', 'D', '120', 'M']
>>> example[1::2]
['M', 'D', 'M']
The [1::2] syntax means: start at index 1, go on until you run out of elements (nothing entered between the : delimiters), and step over the list to return every second value.
You can do the same thing for the numbers, using [::2], so begin with the value right at the start and take every other value.
If you then combine this with the zip() function you can pair up your numbers and letters to figure out what to sum:
def sum_m_values(values):
    summed = []
    m_sum = 0
    for number, letter in zip(values[::2], values[1::2]):
        if letter != ""M"":
            if m_sum:
                summed += (str(m_sum), ""M"")
                m_sum = 0
            summed += (number, letter)
        else:
            m_sum += int(number)
    if m_sum:
        summed += (str(m_sum), ""M"")
    return summed
The above function takes your list of numbers and letters and:
creates a list for the results
tracks a running sum of ""M"" values
pairs up the numbers and letters
for each pair:
if it is a number and ""M"", add that value (as an integer) to the running sum.
otherwise, adds the running sum (if any) to the list with the letter ""M"", then adds the current number and letter too.
after all pairs are processed, adds the running sum and the letter ""M"", if there is any.
This covers all your example inputs:
>>> def sum_m_values(values):
...     summed = []
...     m_sum = 0
...     for number, letter in zip(values[::2], values[1::2]):
...         if letter != ""M"":
...             if m_sum:
...                 summed += (str(m_sum), ""M"")
...                 m_sum = 0
...             summed += (number, letter)
...         else:
...             m_sum += int(number)
...     if m_sum:
...         summed += (str(m_sum), ""M"")
...     return summed
...
>>> examples = [
...     ['20', 'M', '10', 'M', '1', 'D', '14', 'M', '106', 'M'],
...     ['124', 'M', '19', 'M', '7', 'M'],
...     ['19', 'M', '131', 'M'],
...     ['3', 'M', '19', 'M', '128', 'M'],
...     ['12', 'M', '138', 'M'],
... ]
>>> for example in examples:
...     print(example, ""->"", sum_m_values(example))
...
['20', 'M', '10', 'M', '1', 'D', '14', 'M', '106', 'M'] -> ['30', 'M', '1', 'D', '120', 'M']
['124', 'M', '19', 'M', '7', 'M'] -> ['150', 'M']
['19', 'M', '131', 'M'] -> ['150', 'M']
['3', 'M', '19', 'M', '128', 'M'] -> ['150', 'M']
['12', 'M', '138', 'M'] -> ['150', 'M']
There are other methods of looping over a list in fixed-sized groups; you can also create an iterator for the list with iter():
it = iter(inputlist)
for number, letter in zip(it, it):
    # ...
This works because zip() gets the next element for each value in the pair from the same iterator, so ""30"" first, then ""M"", etc.:
>>> example = ['124', 'M', '19', 'M', '7', 'M']
>>> it = iter(example)
>>> for number, letter in zip(it, it):
...     print(number, letter)
...
124 M
19 M
7 M
However, for short lists it is perfectly fine to use slicing, as it can be understood more easily.
Next, you can make the summing a little easier by using itertools.groupby() give you your number + letter pairs as separate groups. That function takes an input sequence, and a function to produce the group identifier. When you then loop over its output you are given that group identifier and an iterator to access the group members.
Just pass it the zip() iterator build before, and either lambda pair: pair[1] or operator.itemgetter(1); the latter is a little faster but does the same thing as the lambda, get the letter from the number + letter pair.
With separate groups, the logic starts to look a lot simpler:
from itertools import groupby
from operator import itemgetter

def sum_m_values(values):
    summed = []
    it = iter(values)
    paired = zip(it, it)

    for letter, grouped in groupby(paired, itemgetter(1)):
        if letter == ""M"":
            total = sum(int(number) for number, _ in grouped)
            summed += (total, letter)
        else:
            # add the (number, ""D"") as separate elements
            for number, letter in grouped:
                summed += (number, letter)
            
    return summed
The output of the function hasn't changed, only the implementation.
Finally, we could turn the function into a generator function, by replacing the summed += ... statements with yield from ..., so it'll still generate a sequence of numeric strings and letters:
from itertools import groupby
from operator import itemgetter

def sum_m_values(values):
    it = iter(values)
    paired = zip(it, it)

    for letter, grouped in groupby(paired, itemgetter(1)):
        if letter == ""M"":
            total = sum(int(number) for number, _ in grouped)
            yield from (total, letter)
        else:
            # add the (number, ""D"") as separate elements
            for number, letter in grouped:
                yield from (number, letter)
You can then use list(sum_m_values(...)) to get a list again, or just use the generator as-is. For long inputs, that could be the preferred option as that means you never need to keep everything in memory all at once.",2022-11-26 16:37:30Z,2

If you just want to get rid of the error, at the cost of risking the security of the project (e.g. it's just a personal project or dev environment), go with @Pras's answer -- ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password' and then flush privileges
If you want to have a fix for it, without knowing why, just install and use mysql2 (instead of mysql) and use it -- npm i mysql2, and mysql = require('mysql2');.
If you are a curious developer who is always eager to learn, keep reading ... :)
What's going on?
Let's first make it clear what's going on.
MySQL 8 has supports pluggable authentication methods. By default, one of them named caching_sha2_password is used rather than our good old mysql_native_password (source). It should be obvious that using a crypto algorithm with several handshakes is more secure than plain password passing that has been there for 24 years!
Now, the problem is mysqljs in Node (the package you install with npm i mysql and use it in your Node code) doesn't support this new default authentication method of MySQL 8, yet. The issue is in here: https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql/issues/1507 and is still open, after 3 years, as of July 2019.
UPDATE June 2019: There is a new PR in mysqljs now to fix this!
UPDATE Feb 2020: Apparently it's scheduled to come in version 3 of mysqljs.
UPDATE July 2020: Apparently it's still not in yet (as of April 2020 at least), but it's claimed that node-mysql2 is supporting Authentication switch request. Please comment below if node-mysql2 is working fine for this issue -- I will test it later myself.
UPDATE April 2021: It seems like the issue is still there and just 3 days ago, someone created a fork and made it there -- yet not official in the mysql.js package. Also, as per the comments below, it seems like mysql2 package is working fine and supporting Authentication-switch properly.
Your Current Options
Option 1) [NOT RECOMMENDED] Downgrade ""MySQL"" to authenticate using good old ""mysql_native_password""
That's what everybody suggests here (e.g. top answer above). You just get into mysql and run a query saying root is fine using old mysql_native_password method for authentication:
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password ...
The good thing is, life is going to be simple and you can still use good old tools like Sequel Pro without any issue. But the problem is, you are not taking advantage of a more secure (and cool, read below) stuffs available to you.
Option 2) [Meh...] Replace ""Node"" package with MySQL Connecter X DevAPI
MySQL X DevAPI for Node is a replacement to Node's Mysqljs package, provided by http://dev.mysql.com official guys.
It works like a charm supporting caching_sha2_password authentication. (Just make sure you use port 33060 for X Protocol communications.)
The bad thing is, you have left our old mysql package that everyone is so used to and relies on.
The good thing is, your app is more secure now and you can take advantage of a ton of new things that our good old friends didn't provide! Just check out the tutorial of X DevAPI and you'll see it has a ton of new sexy features that can come in handy. You just need to pay the price of a learning curve, which expectedly comes with any technology upgrade. :)
PS. Unfortunately, this XDevAPI Package doesn't have types definition (understandable by TypeScript) yet, so if you are on typescript, you will have problems. I tried to generate .d.ts using dts-gen and dtsmake, but no success. So keep that in mind.
Option 3) [RECOMMENDED] Replace ""mysql.js"" with ""mysql2.js"" package
As mentioned above, mysql package (NPM package link) is still having this issue (as of April 2021). But mysql2 package (NPM package link) is not. So probably the following should be the one-liner answer!
npm un mysql && npm i mysql2
Please note that mysql2 is a forked work off of the popular mysql, but its popularity (620K downloads per week for mysql2 in April 2020) has got close to the original package (720K download per week for mysql in April 2021) that making the switch seems reasonable!

This document extensively discusses caching_sha2_password and of course why it should NOT be a first choice to downgrade the authentication method.

1160,74583468,chrwahl,322084,"You need to tell the browser what kind of image/document it is going to display. For SVG documents that means including an XML declaration and the XML namespace.
So, your SVG document should look something like this:
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<svg xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" width=""256"" height=""256""
  viewBox=""0 0 256 256"">
  <rect style=""fill:#FF3010;stroke:none"" width=""256"" height=""256""
    x=""0"" y=""0"" />
</svg>
And then include it just like you write:
<html>
 <head>
  <link rel=""icon"" type=""image/svg+xml"" href=""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0iVVRGLTgiPz4KPHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciCiB3aWR0aD0iMjU2IgogaGVpZ2h0PSIyNTYiCiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjU2IDI1NiI+CiA8cmVjdAogIHN0eWxlPSJmaWxsOiNGRjMwMTA7c3Ryb2tlOm5vbmUiCiAgd2lkdGg9IjI1NiIKICBoZWlnaHQ9IjI1NiIKICB4PSIwIgogIHk9IjAiIC8+Cjwvc3ZnPgo="">
  ...
You can always test if it works by opening the SVG in the browser.
Now, I only tested this using a base64 data URL in Firefox. Maybe in some cases you run into an issue with the origin (CORS). To mitigate this you need a Content-Security-Policy in your HTTP response or at least a Content Security Policy meta element in your HTML that states that data URLs are OK. Something like this:
<meta http-equiv=""Content-Security-Policy"" content=""default-src data:"" />
Here you can see the data: schema mentioned in the policy.",2022-11-26 16:28:47Z,2

1177,74583419,ViaTech,8382028,"In Python when you add two strings together you concatenate the values.
For an easier example:
string_one = ""hello""
string_two = "" ""
string_three = ""there""
final = string_one + string_two + string_3

print(final) # hello there
To add them together mathematically, you need to ensure the values are ints, floats, decimals...
one = 1
two = 2
final = one + two

print(final, type(final)) # 3 int
So for your code:
first_num = int(input('Please enter a number')) 
second_num = int(input('Please enter another number'))
final = first_num + second_num

print(final) # will give you the numbers added
However, you are casting to ints based on user input, so I would ensure you are also catching the errors that occur when a user enters a value that cannot be cast to an int, like hi. For example:
try:
    first_num = int(input('Please enter a number')) 
    second_num = int(input('Please enter another number'))

A destructuring assignment where the left side has [ ...rest] notation will create an array for rest. When it has { ...rest} notation, it will create a plain object for rest.
In the first case, the array values from the right hand side are iterated, and these populate the left hand array.
In the second case, the object entries from the right hand side are iterated, and these define the key/value pairs of the left hand object.
Could someone demonstrate the steps that occur above, without using destructuring?
Like this:
let foo = {};
for (const pair of [1, 2].entries()) {
    foo[pair[0]] = pair[1];
}

Is there a place in the ECMA spec (or similar) where the behavior is explained?
The ECMA Script reference is at Destructuring Assignment, and the ObjectAssignmentPattern with AssignmentRestProperty. In that section you'll find Runtime Semantics: RestDestructuringAssignmentEvaluation.
There you see a plain object is created (in step 2). In step three the procedure CopyDataProperties ( target, source, excludedItems ) is executed. This copies enumerable (see step 4.c.ii) properties of the source object (in your case an array object) into the target object.
It is important to stress that only own, enumerable properties are included, which explains why for instance the length property is not copied into the target object.",2022-11-26 15:58:59Z,3

It would've been better to change the order of select and filter:

I'm not sure what -2 to 2(x) means. Let's assume a linear graph going from -2 to 2 on the X-axis and a drawing JPanel of 1000 x 800 pixels. If your graph uses a logarithmic scale then the math will be much more complicated.
Your X pixel count goes from 0 to 1000. So 0 represents -2 and 1000 represents 2.
The formula to convert values to pixels is:
pixels = (value + 2.0) X 1000 / 4.0  
or, in more general terms
pixels = (value - minimum value) X (total pixels) / (maximum value - minimum value)
The equation is the same for the Y direction unless you want to invert the Y value. Cartesian graphs have the Y axis going upward in a positive direction while a drawing JPanel has Y values increasing going downward.
If you do want to invert the Y axis, the formula is
pixels = total pixels - calculated pixels (the formula already given)",2022-11-26 19:13:00Z,0

  align-self: center;
}
To make all flex-container children same height lets remove all height properties since that is the default behavior of flex-box (when in row direction). And to make para and bg-text divs same width lets use flex: 1. This will make them grow to the same size as long as it has enough space.

  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;

#preview_text {
  /* line-height: 500px; */

For now the flex-container is using full width. To limit it you can use a fixed margin or fixed width. Using percentage for this will create large margins on small screens unless you put different values for different screen sizes (using media queries or the calc and min/max functions). Let's use a fixed width and margin: auto to keep it centralized.

People can use context clues to determine that ""Jon"" and ""Inbar"" are objects joined to the verb ""equals"", but the Python interpreter is more literal minded.
if name == ""Kevin"" or ""Jon"" or ""Inbar"":
is logically equivalent to:
if (name == ""Kevin"") or (""Jon"") or (""Inbar""):
Which, for user Bob, is equivalent to:
if (False) or (""Jon"") or (""Inbar""):
The or operator chooses the first argument with a positive truth value:
if ""Jon"":
And since ""Jon"" has a positive truth value, the if block executes. That is what causes ""Access granted"" to be printed regardless of the name given.
All of this reasoning also applies to the expression if ""Kevin"" or ""Jon"" or ""Inbar"" == name. the first value, ""Kevin"", is true, so the if block executes.
There are two common ways to properly construct this conditional.
Use multiple == operators to explicitly check against each value:
if name == ""Kevin"" or name == ""Jon"" or name == ""Inbar"":
Compose a collection of valid values (a set, a list or a tuple for example), and use the in operator to test for membership:
if name in {""Kevin"", ""Jon"", ""Inbar""}:
In general of the two the second should be preferred as it's easier to read and also faster:
>>> import timeit
>>> timeit.timeit('name == ""Kevin"" or name == ""Jon"" or name == ""Inbar""',
    setup=""name='Inbar'"")
0.4247764749999945

For those who may want proof that if a == b or c or d or e: ... is indeed parsed like this. The built-in ast module provides an answer:

(And adding a few of my points)
Explanation :
if name == ""Kevin"" or ""Jon"" or ""Inbar"":
is logically equivalent to:
if (name == ""Kevin"") or (""Jon"") or (""Inbar""):
Which, for user Bob, is equivalent to:
if (False) or (""Jon"") or (""Inbar""):
NOTE : Python evaluates the logical value of any non-zero integer as True. Therefore, all Non-empty lists, sets, strings, etc. are evaluable and return True
The or operator chooses the first argument with a positive truth value.
Therefore, ""Jon"" has a positive truth value and the if block executes, since it is now equivalent to
if (False) or (True) or (True):
That is what causes ""Access granted"" to be printed regardless of the name input.
Solutions :
Solution 1 : Use multiple == operators to explicitly check against each value
if name == ""Kevin"" or name == ""Jon"" or name == ""Inbar"":
    print(""Access granted."")
else:
    print(""Access denied."")
Solution 2 : Compose a collection of valid values (a set, a list or a tuple for example), and use the in operator to test for membership (faster, preferred method)
if name in {""Kevin"", ""Jon"", ""Inbar""}:

else:
    print(""Access denied."")
OR
if name in [""Kevin"", ""Jon"", ""Inbar""]:
    print(""Access granted."")
else:

Solution 3 : Use the basic (and not very efficient) if-elif-else structure

elif name == ""Inbar"":

1268,20002503,mkrieger1,4621513,"Approaches
How a data scientist approaches this problem
The simplest way possible is to eliminate the need for comparison operators and use a list. This looks impressive on security systems because you learn to access ORMs.
user = input(""Enter name: "")

if user in {""Bob"", ""Kevin"", ""Joe""}:
   print(""Access granted, "" + str(user) + ""."")
else:
   print(""Access denied."")
Or, you can resemble the exact same code above, just put the list of registered users in their own list:
user = input(""Enter name: "")
users = {""Bob"", ""Kevin"", ""Joe"", ""a million more users if you like""}

if user in users:
   print(""Access granted, "" + str(user) + ""."")
else:
   print(""Access denied."")
If you wanted to complete this protocol safely without the risk of attack, set up double parameters. This would check your mini-ORM for first and last name fields, as well as a password or secret question key. Objects can be sorted like this if you want to efficiently lazy-load user credentials without hashing:
def lazy(i):
   j = 0 # For example
   while j < i:
      yield j
      j += 1
The loop will consume only the yielded values to save time and energy on your system:
You can then do something with the iterated list:
for j in lazy_range(10):
   do_something_here(j)
This problem can be approached from any angle: memory management, security, or simply by an organic list or packaged ORM.",2022-01-02 09:47:13Z,-1

You are not given the mean, but imagine a value moving up the real line, and choosing the timestamps from each sorted array that are closest to it. Your choice from any array will only change at the midpoint between two adjacent values.
An O(n) algorithm for this problem is to start with the first elements in each array, and then repeatedly advance in the array with the smallest midpoint between the current element and the next. In this way you will consider all possible sets of closest elements to any point. In python, it looks like this:

for (const auto& ms : vp)
    for (char c : ms)

Also why use new and delete in getItem? And why declare class variables when you should use local variables?
void getItem(char* item) {
    multiset<char> sp;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

sp doesn't need to be a pointer, and it should be a local variable.
EDIT
Also I think getItem has a bug. I'm guessing that you want a new multiset every five character, but that's not what the code does. Maybe this is what you want
void getItem(char* item) {
    multiset<char> sp;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

1282,74583237,Willem Van Onsem,67579,"First of all a common misconception is that State a b contains state. It does not, it changes a state. Indeed, something of a State a b will take a state of type a might change the state (to pass to the next State object), and might ""return"" some value of type b.
If you thus have a function helper1 :: State Int String for example, and a function helper2 :: String -> State Int () you can pass the String that will be returned by the State object of helper1 to construct a State object of helper2, so you can make a function:
func :: State Int ()
func = do
  s <- helper1
  helper2 s
Both helper1 and helper2 s can read the state that will be passed, modify the state, or might for example return the state. But nor func, helper1 and helper2 contain a state. What you can do is work with runState :: State s a -> s -> (s, a). Here you provide an initial state, and you run that state through func for example. We can thus call runState func 0 to run this ""through"" func with initial state 0. It will then return a 2-tuple with the state after it has passed through func and what func returns (in this case the unit value).",2022-11-26 15:08:54Z,0

→ If you already understand the problem, skip to the possible solutions below.
The problem
The A in Ajax stands for asynchronous. That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, $.ajax returns immediately and the next statement, return result;, is executed before the function you passed as success callback was even called.
Here is an analogy which hopefully makes the difference between synchronous and asynchronous flow clearer:
Synchronous
Imagine you make a phone call to a friend and ask him to look something up for you. Although it might take a while, you wait on the phone and stare into space, until your friend gives you the answer that you needed.
The same is happening when you make a function call containing ""normal"" code:
function findItem() {
    var item;
    while(item_not_found) {
        // search
    }
    return item;
}

var item = findItem();

// Do something with item
doSomethingElse();
Even though findItem might take a long time to execute, any code coming after var item = findItem(); has to wait until the function returns the result.
Asynchronous
You call your friend again for the same reason. But this time you tell him that you are in a hurry and he should call you back on your mobile phone. You hang up, leave the house, and do whatever you planned to do. Once your friend calls you back, you are dealing with the information he gave to you.
That's exactly what's happening when you do an Ajax request.
findItem(function(item) {
    // Do something with the item
});
doSomethingElse();
Instead of waiting for the response, the execution continues immediately and the statement after the Ajax call is executed. To get the response eventually, you provide a function to be called once the response was received, a callback (notice something? call back ?). Any statement coming after that call is executed before the callback is called.
Solution(s)
Embrace the asynchronous nature of JavaScript! While certain asynchronous operations provide synchronous counterparts (so does ""Ajax""), it's generally discouraged to use them, especially in a browser context.
Why is it bad do you ask?
JavaScript runs in the UI thread of the browser and any long-running process will lock the UI, making it unresponsive. Additionally, there is an upper limit on the execution time for JavaScript and the browser will ask the user whether to continue the execution or not.
All of this results in a really bad user experience. The user won't be able to tell whether everything is working fine or not. Furthermore, the effect will be worse for users with a slow connection.
In the following we will look at three different solutions that are all building on top of each other:
Promises with async/await (ES2017+, available in older browsers if you use a transpiler or regenerator)
Callbacks (popular in node)
Promises with then() (ES2015+, available in older browsers if you use one of the many promise libraries)
All three are available in current browsers, and node 7+.
ES2017+: Promises with async/await
The ECMAScript version released in 2017 introduced syntax-level support for asynchronous functions. With the help of async and await, you can write asynchronous in a ""synchronous style"". The code is still asynchronous, but it's easier to read/understand.
async/await builds on top of promises: an async function always returns a promise. await ""unwraps"" a promise and either result in the value the promise was resolved with or throws an error if the promise was rejected.
Important: You can only use await inside an async function or in a JavaScript module. Top-level await is not supported outside of modules, so you might have to make an async IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to start an async context if not using a module.
You can read more about async and await on MDN.
Here is an example that elaborates the delay function findItem() above:
// Using 'superagent' which will return a promise.
var superagent = require('superagent')

// This is isn't declared as `async` because it already returns a promise
function delay() {
  // `delay` returns a promise
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // Only `delay` is able to resolve or reject the promise
    setTimeout(function() {
      resolve(42); // After 3 seconds, resolve the promise with value 42
    }, 3000);
  });
}

async function getAllBooks() {
  try {
    // GET a list of book IDs of the current user
    var bookIDs = await superagent.get('/user/books');
    // wait for 3 seconds (just for the sake of this example)
    await delay();
    // GET information about each book
    return superagent.get('/books/ids='+JSON.stringify(bookIDs));
  } catch(error) {
    // If any of the awaited promises was rejected, this catch block
    // would catch the rejection reason
    return null;
  }
}

// Start an IIFE to use `await` at the top level
(async function(){
  let books = await getAllBooks();
  console.log(books);
})();
Current browser and node versions support async/await. You can also support older environments by transforming your code to ES5 with the help of regenerator (or tools that use regenerator, such as Babel).
Let functions accept callbacks
A callback is when function 1 is passed to function 2. Function 2 can call function 1 whenever it is ready. In the context of an asynchronous process, the callback will be called whenever the asynchronous process is done. Usually, the result is passed to the callback.
In the example of the question, you can make foo accept a callback and use it as success callback. So this
var result = foo();
// Code that depends on 'result'
becomes
foo(function(result) {
    // Code that depends on 'result'
});
Here we defined the function ""inline"" but you can pass any function reference:
function myCallback(result) {
    // Code that depends on 'result'
}

foo(myCallback);
foo itself is defined as follows:
function foo(callback) {
    $.ajax({
        // ...
        success: callback
    });
}
callback will refer to the function we pass to foo when we call it and we pass it on to success. I.e. once the Ajax request is successful, $.ajax will call callback and pass the response to the callback (which can be referred to with result, since this is how we defined the callback).
You can also process the response before passing it to the callback:
function foo(callback) {
    $.ajax({
        // ...
        success: function(response) {
            // For example, filter the response
            callback(filtered_response);
        }
    });
}
It's easier to write code using callbacks than it may seem. After all, JavaScript in the browser is heavily event-driven (DOM events). Receiving the Ajax response is nothing else but an event. Difficulties could arise when you have to work with third-party code, but most problems can be solved by just thinking through the application flow.
ES2015+: Promises with then()
The Promise API is a new feature of ECMAScript 6 (ES2015), but it has good browser support already. There are also many libraries which implement the standard Promises API and provide additional methods to ease the use and composition of asynchronous functions (e.g., bluebird).
Promises are containers for future values. When the promise receives the value (it is resolved) or when it is canceled (rejected), it notifies all of its ""listeners"" who want to access this value.
The advantage over plain callbacks is that they allow you to decouple your code and they are easier to compose.
Here is an example of using a promise:
function delay() {
  // `delay` returns a promise
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // Only `delay` is able to resolve or reject the promise
    setTimeout(function() {
      resolve(42); // After 3 seconds, resolve the promise with value 42
    }, 3000);
  });
}

delay()
  .then(function(v) { // `delay` returns a promise
    console.log(v); // Log the value once it is resolved
  })
  .catch(function(v) {
    // Or do something else if it is rejected
    // (it would not happen in this example, since `reject` is not called).
  });

Applied to our Ajax call we could use promises like this:
function ajax(url) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.onload = function() {
      resolve(this.responseText);
    };
    xhr.onerror = reject;
    xhr.open('GET', url);
    xhr.send();
  });
}

ajax(""https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"")
  .then(function(result) {
    console.log(result); // Code depending on result
  })
  .catch(function() {
    // An error occurred
  });
.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }

Describing all the advantages that promise offer is beyond the scope of this answer, but if you write new code, you should seriously consider them. They provide a great abstraction and separation of your code.
More information about promises: HTML5 rocks - JavaScript Promises.
Side note: jQuery's deferred objects
Deferred objects are jQuery's custom implementation of promises (before the Promise API was standardized). They behave almost like promises but expose a slightly different API.
Every Ajax method of jQuery already returns a ""deferred object"" (actually a promise of a deferred object) which you can just return from your function:
function ajax() {
    return $.ajax(...);
}

ajax().done(function(result) {
    // Code depending on result
}).fail(function() {
    // An error occurred
});
Side note: Promise gotchas
Keep in mind that promises and deferred objects are just containers for a future value, they are not the value itself. For example, suppose you had the following:
function checkPassword() {
    return $.ajax({
        url: '/password',
        data: {
            username: $('#username').val(),
            password: $('#password').val()
        },
        type: 'POST',
        dataType: 'json'
    });
}

if (checkPassword()) {
    // Tell the user they're logged in
}
This code misunderstands the above asynchronous issues. Specifically, $.ajax() doesn't freeze the code while it checks the '/password' page on your server - it sends a request to the server and while it waits, it immediately returns a jQuery Ajax Deferred object, not the response from the server. That means the if statement is going to always get this Deferred object, treat it as true, and proceed as though the user is logged in. Not good.
But the fix is easy:
checkPassword()
.done(function(r) {
    if (r) {
        // Tell the user they're logged in
    } else {
        // Tell the user their password was bad
    }
})
.fail(function(x) {
    // Tell the user something bad happened
});
Not recommended: Synchronous ""Ajax"" calls
As I mentioned, some(!) asynchronous operations have synchronous counterparts. I don't advocate their use, but for completeness' sake, here is how you would perform a synchronous call:
Without jQuery
If you directly use a XMLHttpRequest object, pass false as third argument to .open.
jQuery
If you use jQuery, you can set the async option to false. Note that this option is deprecated since jQuery 1.8. You can then either still use a success callback or access the responseText property of the jqXHR object:
function foo() {
    var jqXHR = $.ajax({
        //...
        async: false
    });
    return jqXHR.responseText;
}
If you use any other jQuery Ajax method, such as $.get, $.getJSON, etc., you have to change it to $.ajax (since you can only pass configuration parameters to $.ajax).
Heads up! It is not possible to make a synchronous JSONP request. JSONP by its very nature is always asynchronous (one more reason to not even consider this option).",2022-04-08 13:02:30Z,6486
1285,14220321,Peter Mortensen,63550,"If you're not using jQuery in your code, this answer is for you
Your code should be something along the lines of this:
function foo() {
    var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();

    httpRequest.send();
    return httpRequest.responseText;
}

var result = foo(); // Always ends up being 'undefined'
Felix Kling did a fine job writing an answer for people using jQuery for AJAX, but I've decided to provide an alternative for people who aren't.
(Note, for those using the new fetch API, Angular or promises I've added another answer below)
What you're facing
This is a short summary of ""Explanation of the problem"" from the other answer, if you're not sure after reading this, read that.
The A in AJAX stands for asynchronous. That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, .send returns immediately and the next statement, return result;, is executed before the function you passed as success callback was even called.
This means when you're returning, the listener you've defined did not execute yet, which means the value you're returning has not been defined.
Here is a simple analogy:
function getFive(){
    var a;
    setTimeout(function(){
         a=5;
    },10);
    return a;
}
(Fiddle)
The value of a returned is undefined since the a=5 part has not executed yet. AJAX acts like this, you're returning the value before the server got the chance to tell your browser what that value is.
One possible solution to this problem is to code re-actively , telling your program what to do when the calculation completed.
function onComplete(a){ // When the code completes, do this
    alert(a);
}

function getFive(whenDone){
    var a;
    setTimeout(function(){
         a=5;
         whenDone(a);
    },10);
}
This is called CPS. Basically, we're passing getFive an action to perform when it completes, we're telling our code how to react when an event completes (like our AJAX call, or in this case the timeout).
Usage would be:
getFive(onComplete);
Which should alert ""5"" to the screen. (Fiddle).
Possible solutions
There are basically two ways how to solve this:
Make the AJAX call synchronous (let’s call it SJAX).
Restructure your code to work properly with callbacks.
1. Synchronous AJAX - Don't do it!!
As for synchronous AJAX, don't do it! Felix's answer raises some compelling arguments about why it's a bad idea. To sum it up, it'll freeze the user's browser until the server returns the response and create a very bad user experience. Here is another short summary taken from MDN on why:
XMLHttpRequest supports both synchronous and asynchronous communications. In general, however, asynchronous requests should be preferred to synchronous requests for performance reasons.
In short, synchronous requests block the execution of code... ...this can cause serious issues...
If you have to do it, you can pass a flag. Here is how:
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', 'yourURL', false);  // `false` makes the request synchronous
request.send(null);

if (request.status === 200) {// That's HTTP for 'ok'
  console.log(request.responseText);
}
2. Restructure code
Let your function accept a callback. In the example code foo can be made to accept a callback. We'll be telling our code how to react when foo completes.
So:
var result = foo();
// Code that depends on `result` goes here
Becomes:
foo(function(result) {
    // Code that depends on `result`
});
Here we passed an anonymous function, but we could just as easily pass a reference to an existing function, making it look like:
function myHandler(result) {
    // Code that depends on `result`
}
foo(myHandler);
For more details on how this sort of callback design is done, check Felix's answer.
Now, let's define foo itself to act accordingly
function foo(callback) {
    var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
    httpRequest.onload = function(){ // When the request is loaded
       callback(httpRequest.responseText);// We're calling our method
    };
    httpRequest.open('GET', ""/echo/json"");
    httpRequest.send();
}
(fiddle)
We have now made our foo function accept an action to run when the AJAX completes successfully. We can extend this further by checking if the response status is not 200 and acting accordingly (create a fail handler and such). Effectively it is solving our issue.
If you're still having a hard time understanding this, read the AJAX getting started guide at MDN.",2021-04-09 11:45:40Z,1199
1286,14220321,Peter Mortensen,63550,"XMLHttpRequest 2 (first of all, read the answers from Benjamin Gruenbaum and Felix Kling)
If you don't use jQuery and want a nice short XMLHttpRequest 2 which works in the modern browsers and also in the mobile browsers, I suggest to use it this way:
function ajax(a, b, c){ // URL, callback, just a placeholder
  c = new XMLHttpRequest;
  c.open('GET', a);
  c.onload = b;
  c.send()
}
As you can see:
It's shorter than all other functions Listed.
The callback is set directly (so no extra unnecessary closures).
It uses the new onload (so you don't have to check for readystate && status)
There are some other situations, which I don't remember, that make the XMLHttpRequest 1 annoying.
There are two ways to get the response of this Ajax call (three using the XMLHttpRequest var name):
The simplest:
this.response
Or if for some reason you bind() the callback to a class:
e.target.response
Example:
function callback(e){
  console.log(this.response);
}
ajax('URL', callback);
Or (the above one is better anonymous functions are always a problem):
ajax('URL', function(e){console.log(this.response)});
Nothing easier.
Now some people will probably say that it's better to use onreadystatechange or the even the XMLHttpRequest variable name. That's wrong.
Check out XMLHttpRequest advanced features.
It supported all *modern browsers. And I can confirm as I have been using this approach since XMLHttpRequest 2 was created. I never had any type of problem in any browsers I used.
onreadystatechange is only useful if you want to get the headers on state 2.
Using the XMLHttpRequest variable name is another big error as you need to execute the callback inside the onload/oreadystatechange closures, or else you lost it.
Now if you want something more complex using POST and FormData you can easily extend this function:
function x(a, b, e, d, c){ // URL, callback, method, formdata or {key:val},placeholder
  c = new XMLHttpRequest;
  c.open(e||'get', a);
  c.onload = b;
  c.send(d||null)
}
Again ... it's a very short function, but it does GET and POST.
Examples of usage:
x(url, callback); // By default it's GET so no need to set
x(url, callback, 'post', {'key': 'val'}); // No need to set POST data
Or pass a full form element (document.getElementsByTagName('form')[0]):
var fd = new FormData(form);
x(url, callback, 'post', fd);
Or set some custom values:
var fd = new FormData();
fd.append('key', 'val')
x(url, callback, 'post', fd);
As you can see, I didn't implement sync... it's a bad thing.
Having said that ... why don't we do it the easy way?
As mentioned in the comment, the use of error && synchronous does completely break the point of the answer. Which is a nice short way to use Ajax in the proper way?
Error handler
function x(a, b, e, d, c){ // URL, callback, method, formdata or {key:val}, placeholder
  c = new XMLHttpRequest;
  c.open(e||'get', a);
  c.onload = b;
  c.onerror = error;
  c.send(d||null)
}

function error(e){
  console.log('--Error--', this.type);
  console.log('this: ', this);
  console.log('Event: ', e)
}
function displayAjax(e){
  console.log(e, this);
}
x('WRONGURL', displayAjax);
In the above script, you have an error handler which is statically defined, so it does not compromise the function. The error handler can be used for other functions too.
But to really get out an error, the only way is to write a wrong URL in which case every browser throws an error.
Error handlers are maybe useful if you set custom headers, set the responseType to blob array buffer, or whatever...
Even if you pass 'POSTAPAPAP' as the method it won't throw an error.
Even if you pass 'fdggdgilfdghfldj' as formdata it won't throw an error.
In the first case the error is inside the displayAjax() under this.statusText as Method not Allowed.
In the second case, it simply works. You have to check at the server side if you passed the right post data.
Cross-domain not allowed throws an error automatically.
In the error response, there aren't any error codes.
There is only the this.type which is set to error.
Why add an error handler if you totally don't have any control over errors? Most of the errors are returned inside this in the callback function displayAjax().
So: There isn't any need for error checks if you're able to copy and paste the URL properly. ;)
PS: As the first test I wrote x('x', displayAjax)..., and it totally got a response...??? So I checked the folder where the HTML is located, and there was a file called 'x.xml'. So even if you forget the extension of your file XMLHttpRequest 2 WILL FIND IT. I LOL'd
Read a file synchronous
Don't do that.
If you want to block the browser for a while load a nice big .txt file synchronous.
function omg(a, c){ // URL
  c = new XMLHttpRequest;
  c.open('GET', a, true);
  c.send();
  return c; // Or c.response
}
Now you can do
 var res = omg('thisIsGonnaBlockThePage.txt');
There is no other way to do this in a non-asynchronous way. (Yeah, with setTimeout loop... but seriously?)
Another point is... if you work with APIs or just your own list's files or whatever you always use different functions for each request...
Only if you have a page where you load always the same XML/JSON or whatever you need only one function. In that case, modify a little the Ajax function and replace b with your special function.
The functions above are for basic use.
If you want to extend the function...
Yes, you can.
I'm using a lot of APIs and one of the first functions I integrate into every HTML page is the first Ajax function in this answer, with GET only...
But you can do a lot of stuff with XMLHttpRequest 2:
I made a download manager (using ranges on both sides with resume, filereader, and filesystem), various image resizers converters using canvas, populate web SQL databases with base64images and much more...
But in these cases you should create a function only for that purpose... sometimes you need a blob, array buffers, you can set headers, override mimetype and there is a lot more...
But the question here is how to return an Ajax response... (I added an easy way.)",2021-04-09 11:57:18Z,444
1287,14220321,Peter Mortensen,63550,"If you're using promises, this answer is for you.
This means AngularJS, jQuery (with deferred), native XHR's replacement (fetch), Ember.js, Backbone.js's save or any Node.js library that returns promises.
Your code should be something along the lines of this:
function foo() {
    var data;
    // Or $.get(...).then, or request(...).then, or query(...).then
    fetch(""/echo/json"").then(function(response){
        data = response.json();

    return data;
}

var result = foo(); // 'result' is always undefined no matter what.
Felix Kling did a fine job writing an answer for people using jQuery with callbacks for Ajax. I have an answer for native XHR. This answer is for generic usage of promises either on the frontend or backend.
The core issue
The JavaScript concurrency model in the browser and on the server with Node.js/io.js is asynchronous and reactive.
Whenever you call a method that returns a promise, the then handlers are always executed asynchronously - that is, after the code below them that is not in a .then handler.
This means when you're returning data the then handler you've defined did not execute yet. This in turn means that the value you're returning has not been set to the correct value in time.
Here is a simple analogy for the issue:
    function getFive(){
        var data;
        setTimeout(function(){ // Set a timer for one second in the future
           data = 5; // After a second, do this
        }, 1000);
        return data;
    }
    document.body.innerHTML = getFive(); // `undefined` here and not 5
Run code snippetExpand snippet
The value of data is undefined since the data = 5 part has not executed yet. It will likely execute in a second, but by that time it is irrelevant to the returned value.
Since the operation did not happen yet (Ajax, server call, I/O, and timer) you're returning the value before the request got the chance to tell your code what that value is.
One possible solution to this problem is to code re-actively, telling your program what to do when the calculation completed. Promises actively enable this by being temporal (time-sensitive) in nature.
Quick recap on promises
A Promise is a value over time. Promises have state. They start as pending with no value and can settle to:
fulfilled meaning that the computation completed successfully.
rejected meaning that the computation failed.
A promise can only change states once after which it will always stay at the same state forever. You can attach then handlers to promises to extract their value and handle errors. then handlers allow chaining of calls. Promises are created by using APIs that return them. For example, the more modern Ajax replacement fetch or jQuery's $.get return promises.
When we call .then on a promise and return something from it - we get a promise for the processed value. If we return another promise we'll get amazing things, but let's hold our horses.
With promises
Let's see how we can solve the above issue with promises. First, let's demonstrate our understanding of promise states from above by using the Promise constructor for creating a delay function:
function delay(ms){ // Takes amount of milliseconds
    // Returns a new promise
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
        setTimeout(function(){ // When the time is up,
            resolve(); // change the promise to the fulfilled state
        }, ms);
    });
}
Now, after we converted setTimeout to use promises, we can use then to make it count:
function delay(ms){ // Takes amount of milliseconds
  // Returns a new promise
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout(function(){ // When the time is up,
      resolve(); // change the promise to the fulfilled state
    }, ms);
  });
}

function getFive(){
  // We're RETURNING the promise. Remember, a promise is a wrapper over our value
  return delay(100).then(function(){ // When the promise is ready,
      return 5; // return the value 5. Promises are all about return values
  })
}
// We _have_ to wrap it like this in the call site, and we can't access the plain value
getFive().then(function(five){
   document.body.innerHTML = five;
});
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Basically, instead of returning a value which we can't do because of the concurrency model - we're returning a wrapper for a value that we can unwrap with then. It's like a box you can open with then.
Applying this
This stands the same for your original API call, you can:
function foo() {
    // RETURN the promise
    return fetch(""/echo/json"").then(function(response){
        return response.json(); // Process it inside the `then`
    });
}

foo().then(function(response){
    // Access the value inside the `then`
})
So this works just as well. We've learned we can't return values from already asynchronous calls, but we can use promises and chain them to perform processing. We now know how to return the response from an asynchronous call.
ES2015 (ES6)
ES6 introduces generators which are functions that can return in the middle and then resume the point they were at. This is typically useful for sequences, for example:
function* foo(){ // Notice the star. This is ES6, so new browsers, Nodes.js, and io.js only
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    while(true) yield 3;
}
Is a function that returns an iterator over the sequence 1,2,3,3,3,3,.... which can be iterated. While this is interesting on its own and opens room for a lot of possibility, there is one particular interesting case.
If the sequence we're producing is a sequence of actions rather than numbers - we can pause the function whenever an action is yielded and wait for it before we resume the function. So instead of a sequence of numbers, we need a sequence of future values - that is: promises.
This somewhat a tricky, but very powerful trick let’s us write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner. There are several ""runners"" that do this for you. Writing one is a short few lines of code, but it is beyond the scope of this answer. I'll be using Bluebird's Promise.coroutine here, but there are other wrappers like co or Q.async.
var foo = coroutine(function*(){
    var data = yield fetch(""/echo/json""); // Notice the yield
    // The code here only executes _after_ the request is done
    return data.json(); // 'data' is defined
});
This method returns a promise itself, which we can consume from other coroutines. For example:
var main = coroutine(function*(){
   var bar = yield foo(); // Wait our earlier coroutine. It returns a promise
   // The server call is done here, and the code below executes when done
   var baz = yield fetch(""/api/users/"" + bar.userid); // Depends on foo's result
   console.log(baz); // Runs after both requests are done
});
main();
ES2016 (ES7)
In ES7, this is further standardized. There are several proposals right now, but in all of them you can await promise. This is just ""sugar"" (nicer syntax) for the ES6 proposal above by adding the async and await keywords. Making the above example:
async function foo(){
    var data = await fetch(""/echo/json""); // Notice the await
    // code here only executes _after_ the request is done
    return data.json(); // 'data' is defined
}
It still returns a promise just the same :)",2021-04-09 13:10:23Z,362

People who are using AngularJS, can handle this situation using promises.
Here it says,
Promises can be used to unnest asynchronous functions and allows one to chain multiple functions together.
You can find a nice explanation here also.
An example found in documentation mentioned below.
  promiseB = promiseA.then(
    function onSuccess(result) {
      return result + 1;
    }
    ,function onError(err) {
      // Handle error
    }
  );

 // promiseB will be resolved immediately after promiseA is resolved
 // and its value will be the result of promiseA incremented by 1.
Angular 2 and later
In Angular 2 with look at the following example, but its recommended to use observables with Angular 2.
 search(term: string) {
     return this.http
       .get(`https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=${term}&type=artist`)
       .map((response) => response.json())
       .toPromise();
}
You can consume that in this way,
search() {
    this.searchService.search(this.searchField.value)
      .then((result) => {
    this.result = result.artists.items;
  })
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
}
See the original post here. But TypeScript does not support native ES6 Promises, if you want to use it, you might need plugin for that.
Additionally, here is the promises specification.",2021-04-09 12:33:24Z,182
1292,14220321,Henke,9213345,"Most of the answers here give useful suggestions for when you have a single async operation, but sometimes, this comes up when you need to do an asynchronous operation for each entry in an array or other list-like structure. The temptation is to do this:
// WRONG
var results = [];
theArray.forEach(function(entry) {
    doSomethingAsync(entry, function(result) {
        results.push(result);
    });
});
console.log(results); // E.g., using them, returning them, etc.
Example:
Show code snippet
The reason that doesn't work is that the callbacks from doSomethingAsync haven't run yet by the time you're trying to use the results.
So, if you have an array (or list of some kind) and want to do async operations for each entry, you have two options: Do the operations in parallel (overlapping), or in series (one after another in sequence).
Parallel
You can start all of them and keep track of how many callbacks you're expecting, and then use the results when you've gotten that many callbacks:
var results = [];
var expecting = theArray.length;
theArray.forEach(function(entry, index) {
    doSomethingAsync(entry, function(result) {
        results[index] = result;
        if (--expecting === 0) {
            // Done!
            console.log(""Results:"", results); // E.g., using the results
        }
    });
});
Example:
Show code snippet
(We could do away with expecting and just use results.length === theArray.length, but that leaves us open to the possibility that theArray is changed while the calls are outstanding...)
Notice how we use the index from forEach to save the result in results in the same position as the entry it relates to, even if the results arrive out of order (since async calls don't necessarily complete in the order in which they were started).
But what if you need to return those results from a function? As the other answers have pointed out, you can't; you have to have your function accept and call a callback (or return a Promise). Here's a callback version:
function doSomethingWith(theArray, callback) {
    var results = [];
    var expecting = theArray.length;
    theArray.forEach(function(entry, index) {
        doSomethingAsync(entry, function(result) {
            results[index] = result;
            if (--expecting === 0) {
                // Done!
                callback(results);
            }
        });
    });
}
doSomethingWith(theArray, function(results) {
    console.log(""Results:"", results);
});
Example:
Show code snippet
Or here's a version returning a Promise instead:
function doSomethingWith(theArray) {
    return new Promise(function(resolve) {
        var results = [];
        var expecting = theArray.length;
        theArray.forEach(function(entry, index) {
            doSomethingAsync(entry, function(result) {
                results[index] = result;
                if (--expecting === 0) {
                    // Done!
                    resolve(results);
                }
            });
        });
    });
}
doSomethingWith(theArray).then(function(results) {
    console.log(""Results:"", results);
});
Of course, if doSomethingAsync passed us errors, we'd use reject to reject the promise when we got an error.)
Example:
Show code snippet
(Or alternately, you could make a wrapper for doSomethingAsync that returns a promise, and then do the below...)
If doSomethingAsync gives you a Promise, you can use Promise.all:
function doSomethingWith(theArray) {
    return Promise.all(theArray.map(function(entry) {
        return doSomethingAsync(entry);
    }));
}
doSomethingWith(theArray).then(function(results) {
    console.log(""Results:"", results);
});
If you know that doSomethingAsync will ignore a second and third argument, you can just pass it directly to map (map calls its callback with three arguments, but most people only use the first most of the time):
function doSomethingWith(theArray) {
    return Promise.all(theArray.map(doSomethingAsync));
}
doSomethingWith(theArray).then(function(results) {
    console.log(""Results:"", results);
});
Example:
Show code snippet
Note that Promise.all resolves its promise with an array of the results of all of the promises you give it when they are all resolved, or rejects its promise when the first of the promises you give it rejects.
Series
Suppose you don't want the operations to be in parallel? If you want to run them one after another, you need to wait for each operation to complete before you start the next. Here's an example of a function that does that and calls a callback with the result:
function doSomethingWith(theArray, callback) {
    var results = [];
    doOne(0);
    function doOne(index) {
        if (index < theArray.length) {
            doSomethingAsync(theArray[index], function(result) {
                results.push(result);
                doOne(index + 1);
            });
        } else {
            // Done!
            callback(results);
        }
    }
}
doSomethingWith(theArray, function(results) {
    console.log(""Results:"", results);
});
(Since we're doing the work in series, we can just use results.push(result) since we know we won't get results out of order. In the above we could have used results[index] = result;, but in some of the following examples we don't have an index to use.)
Example:
Show code snippet
(Or, again, build a wrapper for doSomethingAsync that gives you a promise and do the below...)
If doSomethingAsync gives you a Promise, if you can use ES2017+ syntax (perhaps with a transpiler like Babel), you can use an async function with for-of and await:
async function doSomethingWith(theArray) {
    const results = [];
    for (const entry of theArray) {
        results.push(await doSomethingAsync(entry));
    }
    return results;
}
doSomethingWith(theArray).then(results => {
    console.log(""Results:"", results);
});
Example:
Show code snippet
If you can't use ES2017+ syntax (yet), you can use a variation on the ""Promise reduce"" pattern (this is more complex than the usual Promise reduce because we're not passing the result from one into the next, but instead gathering up their results in an array):
function doSomethingWith(theArray) {
    return theArray.reduce(function(p, entry) {
        return p.then(function(results) {
            return doSomethingAsync(entry).then(function(result) {
                results.push(result);
                return results;
            });
        });
    }, Promise.resolve([]));
}
doSomethingWith(theArray).then(function(results) {
    console.log(""Results:"", results);
});
Example:
Show code snippet
...which is less cumbersome with ES2015+ arrow functions:
function doSomethingWith(theArray) {
    return theArray.reduce((p, entry) => p.then(results => doSomethingAsync(entry).then(result => {
        results.push(result);
        return results;
    })), Promise.resolve([]));
}
doSomethingWith(theArray).then(results => {
    console.log(""Results:"", results);

    getJoke().then(function(res) {

So if you are using Angular, React, or any other frameworks which do two-way data binding or store concept, this issue is simply fixed for you, so in easy words, your result is undefined at the first stage, so you have got result = undefined before you receive the data, then as soon as you get the result, it will be updated and get assigned to the new value which response of your Ajax call...
But how you can do it in pure JavaScript or jQuery for example as you asked in this question?
You can use a callback, promise and recently observable to handle it for you. For example, in promises we have some function like success() or then() which will be executed when your data is ready for you. The same with callback or the subscribe function on an observable.
For example, in your case which you are using jQuery, you can do something like this:
$(document).ready(function(){
    function foo() {
        $.ajax({url: ""api/data"", success: function(data){
            fooDone(data); // After we have data, we pass it to fooDone

1295,14220321,Peter Mortensen,63550,"It's a very common issue we face while struggling with the 'mysteries' of JavaScript. Let me try demystifying this mystery today.
Let's start with a simple JavaScript function:
function foo(){
    // Do something
    return 'wohoo';
}

let bar = foo(); // 'bar' is 'wohoo' here
That's a simple synchronous function call (where each line of code is 'finished with its job' before the next one in sequence), and the result is same as expected.
Now let's add a bit of twist, by introducing a little delay in our function, so that all lines of code are not 'finished' in sequence. Thus, it will emulate the asynchronous behavior of the function:
function foo(){
    setTimeout( ()=> {
        return 'wohoo';
   }, 1000)
}

let bar = foo() // 'bar' is undefined here
So there you go; that delay just broke the functionality we expected! But what exactly happened? Well, it's actually pretty logical if you look at the code.
The function foo(), upon execution, returns nothing (thus returned value is undefined), but it does start a timer, which executes a function after 1 second to return 'wohoo'. But as you can see, the value that's assigned to bar is the immediately returned stuff from foo(), which is nothing, i.e., just undefined.
So, how do we tackle this issue?
Let's ask our function for a promise. Promise is really about what it means: it means that the function guarantees you to provide with any output it gets in future. So let's see it in action for our little problem above:
function foo(){
   return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { // I want foo() to PROMISE me something
    setTimeout ( function(){
      // Promise is RESOLVED, when the execution reaches this line of code
       resolve('wohoo') // After 1 second, RESOLVE the promise with value 'wohoo'
    }, 1000 )
  })
}

let bar;
foo().then( res => {
    bar = res;
    console.log(bar) // Will print 'wohoo'
});
Thus, the summary is - to tackle the asynchronous functions like Ajax-based calls, etc., you can use a promise to resolve the value (which you intend to return). Thus, in short you resolve value instead of returning, in asynchronous functions.
UPDATE (Promises with async/await)
Apart from using then/catch to work with promises, there exists one more approach. The idea is to recognize an asynchronous function and then wait for the promises to resolve, before moving to the next line of code. It's still just the promises under the hood, but with a different syntactical approach. To make things clearer, you can find a comparison below:
then/catch version:
function saveUsers(){
     getUsers()
      .then(users => {
         saveSomewhere(users);
      })
      .catch(err => {
          console.error(err);
       })
 }

  async function saveUsers(){
     try{
        let users = await getUsers()
        saveSomewhere(users);

        console.error(err);

Handle asynchronous HTTP calls;
Wait for response from each API call;
Use Promise pattern;
Use Promise.all pattern to join multiple HTTP calls;
This working example is self-contained. It will define a simple request object that uses the window XMLHttpRequest object to make calls. It will define a simple function to wait for a bunch of promises to be completed.
Context. The example is querying the Spotify Web API endpoint in order to search for playlist objects for a given set of query strings:
[
 ""search?type=playlist&q=%22doom%20metal%22"",
 ""search?type=playlist&q=Adele""
]
For each item, a new Promise will fire a block - ExecutionBlock, parse the result, schedule a new set of promises based on the result array, that is a list of Spotify user objects and execute the new HTTP call within the ExecutionProfileBlock asynchronously.
You can then see a nested Promise structure, that lets you spawn multiple and completely asynchronous nested HTTP calls, and join the results from each subset of calls through Promise.all.
NOTE Recent Spotify search APIs will require an access token to be specified in the request headers:
-H ""Authorization: Bearer {your access token}"" 
So, you to run the following example you need to put your access token in the request headers:
var spotifyAccessToken = ""YourSpotifyAccessToken"";

1300,14220321,404,3733070,"JavaScript is single threaded.
The browser can be divided into three parts:
Event Loop
Web API
Event Queue
The event loop runs for forever, i.e., kind of an infinite loop. The event queue is where all your functions are pushed on some event (example: click).
This is one by one carried out of queue and put into the event loop which executes this function and prepares itself for the next one after the first one is executed. This means execution of one function doesn't start until the function before it in the queue is executed in the event loop.
Now let us think we pushed two functions in a queue. One is for getting a data from the server and another utilises that data. We pushed the serverRequest() function in the queue first and then the utiliseData() function. The serverRequest function goes in the event loop and makes a call to server as we never know how much time it will take to get data from server, so this process is expected to take time and so we busy our event loop thus hanging our page.
That's where Web API come into the role. It takes this function from the event loop and deals with the server making the event loop free, so that we can execute the next function from the queue.
The next function in the queue is utiliseData() which goes in the loop, but because of no data available, it goes to waste and execution of the next function continues until the end of the queue. (This is called Async calling, i.e., we can do something else until we get data.)
Let us suppose our serverRequest() function had a return statement in code. When we get back data from the server Web API, it will push it in the queue at the end of queue.
As it gets pushed at the end of the queue, we cannot utilise its data as there isn't any function left in our queue to utilise this data. Thus it is not possible to return something from the async call.
Thus the solution to this is callback or promise.
An image from one of the answers here correctly explains callback use...*
We give our function (function utilising data returned from the server) to a function calling the server.
function doAjax(callbackFunc, method, url) {
    var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xmlHttpReq.open(method, url);
    xmlHttpReq.onreadystatechange = function() {

        if (xmlHttpReq.readyState == 4 && xmlHttpReq.status == 200) {
            callbackFunc(xmlHttpReq.responseText);
        }
    }
    xmlHttpReq.send(null);
}
In my code it is called as:
function loadMyJson(categoryValue){
    if(categoryValue === ""veg"")
        doAjax(print, ""GET"", ""http://localhost:3004/vegetables"");
    else if(categoryValue === ""fruits"")

user663031",34959258,"We find ourselves in a universe which appears to progress along a dimension we call ""time"". We don't really understand what time is, but we have developed abstractions and vocabulary that let us reason and talk about it: ""past"", ""present"", ""future"", ""before"", ""after"".
The computer systems we build--more and more--have time as an important dimension. Certain things are set up to happen in the future. Then other things need to happen after those first things eventually occur. This is the basic notion called ""asynchronicity"". In our increasingly networked world, the most common case of asynchronicity is waiting for some remote system to respond to some request.
Consider an example. You call the milkman and order some milk. When it comes, you want to put it in your coffee. You can't put the milk in your coffee right now, because it is not here yet. You have to wait for it to come before putting it in your coffee. In other words, the following won't work:
var milk = order_milk();
put_in_coffee(milk);
Because JavaScript has no way to know that it needs to wait for order_milk to finish before it executes put_in_coffee. In other words, it does not know that order_milk is asynchronous--is something that is not going to result in milk until some future time. JavaScript, and other declarative languages execute one statement after another without waiting.
The classic JavaScript approach to this problem, taking advantage of the fact that JavaScript supports functions as first-class objects which can be passed around, is to pass a function as a parameter to the asynchronous request, which it will then invoke when it has completed its task sometime in the future. That is the ""callback"" approach. It looks like this:
order_milk(put_in_coffee);
order_milk kicks off, orders the milk, then, when and only when it arrives, it invokes put_in_coffee.
The problem with this callback approach is that it pollutes the normal semantics of a function reporting its result with return; instead, functions must not reports their results by calling a callback given as a parameter. Also, this approach can rapidly become unwieldy when dealing with longer sequences of events. For example, let's say that I want to wait for the milk to be put in the coffee, and then and only then perform a third step, namely drinking the coffee. I end up needing to write something like this:
order_milk(function(milk) { put_in_coffee(milk, drink_coffee); }
where I am passing to put_in_coffee both the milk to put in it, and also the action (drink_coffee) to execute once the milk has been put in. Such code becomes hard to write, and read, and debug.
In this case, we could rewrite the code in the question as:
var answer;
$.ajax('/foo.json') . done(function(response) {
  callback(response.data);
});

function callback(data) {
  console.log(data);
}
Enter promises
This was the motivation for the notion of a ""promise"", which is a particular type of value which represents a future or asynchronous outcome of some sort. It can represent something that already happened, or that is going to happen in the future, or might never happen at all. Promises have a single method, named then, to which you pass an action to be executed when the outcome the promise represents has been realized.
In the case of our milk and coffee, we design order_milk to return a promise for the milk arriving, then specify put_in_coffee as a then action, as follows:
order_milk() . then(put_in_coffee)
One advantage of this is that we can string these together to create sequences of future occurrences (""chaining""):
order_milk() . then(put_in_coffee) . then(drink_coffee)
Let's apply promises to your particular problem. We will wrap our request logic inside a function, which returns a promise:
function get_data() {
  return $.ajax('/foo.json');
}
Actually, all we've done is added a return to the call to $.ajax. This works because jQuery's $.ajax already returns a kind of promise-like thing. (In practice, without getting into details, we would prefer to wrap this call so as for return a real promise, or use some alternative to $.ajax that does so.) Now, if we want to load the file and wait for it to finish and then do something, we can simply say
get_data() . then(do_something)
for instance,
get_data() .
  then(function(data) { console.log(data); });
When using promises, we end up passing lots of functions into then, so it's often helpful to use the more compact ES6-style arrow functions:
get_data() .
  then(data => console.log(data));
The async keyword
But there's still something vaguely dissatisfying about having to write code one way if synchronous and a quite different way if asynchronous. For synchronous, we write
a();
b();
but if a is asynchronous, with promises we have to write
a() . then(b);
Above, we said, ""JavaScript has no way to know that it needs to wait for the first call to finish before it executes the second"". Wouldn't it be nice if there was some way to tell JavaScript that? It turns out that there is--the await keyword, used inside a special type of function called an ""async"" function. This feature is part of the upcoming version of ECMAScript (ES), but it is already available in transpilers such as Babel given the right presets. This allows us to simply write
async function morning_routine() {
  var milk   = await order_milk();
  var coffee = await put_in_coffee(milk);
  await drink(coffee);
}
In your case, you would be able to write something like
async function foo() {
  data = await get_data();
  console.log(data);

As for many others, my encounter with asynchronous calls was puzzling at first.
I don't remember the details, but I may have tried something like:
let result;

$.ajax({

  success: function (response) {
    console.log('\nInside $.ajax:');
    console.log(response);

Run code snippetExpand snippet
Whoops! The output of the line console.log('Finally, the result: ' + result); which I thought would be printed last, is actually printed before the other output! – And it doesn't contain the result: it just prints undefined. 1 How come?
A helpful insight
I distinctly remember my first aha! moment on how to understand asynchronous calls.
It was this comment saying:
you actually don't want to get the data out of a callback;
you want to get your data-needing action into the callback! 2
This is obvious in the example above.
But is it still possible to write code after the asynchronous call that deals with the response once it has completed?
2. Plain JavaScript and a callback function
The answer is yes! – It is possible.
One alternative is the use of a callback function in a continuation-passing style: 3
const url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/2';

function asynchronousCall (callback) {
  const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  request.open('GET', url);
  request.send();
  request.onload = function () {
    if (request.readyState === request.DONE) {
      console.log('The request is done. Now calling back.');
      callback(request.responseText);
    }
  };
}

asynchronousCall(function (result) {
  console.log('This is the start of the callback function. Result:');
  console.log(result);
  console.log('The callback function finishes on this line. THE END!');
});

console.log('LAST in the code, but executed FIRST!');
.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Note how the function asynchronousCall is void. It returns nothing. Instead, by calling asynchronousCall with an anonymous callback function (asynchronousCall(function (result) {...), this function executes the desired actions on the result, but only after the request has completed – when the responseText is available.
Running the above snippet shows how I will probably not want to write any code after the asyncronous call (such as the line LAST in the code, but executed FIRST!).
Why? – Because such code will happen before the asyncronous call delivers any response data.
Doing so is bound to cause confusion when comparing the code with the output.
3. Promise with .then() – or async/await
The .then() construct was introduced in the ECMA-262 6th Edition in June 2015, and the async/await construct was introduced in the ECMA-262 8th Edition in June 2017.
The code below is still plain JavaScript, replacing the old-school XMLHttpRequest with Fetch. 4
fetch('http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(responseBody => {
    console.log('.then() - the response body:');
    console.log(JSON.stringify(responseBody) + '\n\n');
  });

async function receiveAndAwaitPromise () {
  const responseBody =
    (await fetch('http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random')).json();
  console.log('async/await:');
  console.log(JSON.stringify(await responseBody) + '\n\n');
}

receiveAndAwaitPromise();
.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }
Run code snippetExpand snippet
A word of warning is warranted if you decide to go with the async/await construct. Note in the above snippet how await is needed in two places. If forgotten in the first place, there will be no output. If forgotten in the second place, the only output will be the empty object, {} (or [object Object] or [object Promise]).
Forgetting the async prefix of the function is maybe the worst of all – the output will be ""SyntaxError: missing ) in parenthetical"" – no mentioning of the missing async keyword.
4. Promise.all – array of URLs 5
Suppose we need to request a whole bunch of URLs. I could send one request, wait till it responds, then send the next request, wait till it responds, and so on ...
Aargh! – That could take a loong time. Wouldn't it be better if I could send them all at once, and then wait no longer than it takes for the slowest response to arrive?
As a simplified example, I will use:
urls = ['https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/2',
        'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/3']
The JSONs of the two URLs:
{""userId"":1,""id"":2,""title"":""quis ut nam facilis et officia qui"",
 ""completed"":false}
{""userId"":1,""id"":3,""title"":""fugiat veniam minus"",""completed"":false}
The goal is to get an array of objects, where each object contains the title value from the corresponding URL.
To make it a little more interesting, I will assume that there is already an array of names that I want the array of URL results (the titles) to be merged with:
namesonly = ['two', 'three']
The desired output is a mashup combining namesonly and urls into an array of objects:
[{""name"":""two"",""loremipsum"":""quis ut nam facilis et officia qui""},
{""name"":""three"",""loremipsum"":""fugiat veniam minus""}]
where I have changed the name of title to loremipsum.
const namesonly = ['two','three'];

const urls = ['https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/2',
  'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/3'];

Promise.all(urls.map(url => fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(responseBody => responseBody.title)))
  .then(titles => {
    const names = namesonly.map(value => ({ name: value }));
    console.log('names: ' + JSON.stringify(names));
    const latins = titles.map(value => ({ loremipsum: value }));
    console.log('latins:\n' + JSON.stringify(latins));
    const result =
      names.map((item, i) => Object.assign({}, item, latins[i]));
    console.log('result:\n' + JSON.stringify(result));
  });

5. How to visualize a mashup in Postman 6
The MusicBrainz API has information about artists and music bands.
An example – a request for the British rock band Coldplay is:
http://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/artist/cc197bad-dc9c-440d-a5b5-d52ba2e14234?&fmt=json&inc=url-rels+release-groups.
The JSON response contains – among other things – the 25 earliest album titles by the band. This information is in the release-groups array. The start of this array, including its first object is:
...
  ""release-groups"": [
    {
      ""id"": ""1dc4c347-a1db-32aa-b14f-bc9cc507b843"",
      ""secondary-type-ids"": [],
      ""first-release-date"": ""2000-07-10"",
      ""primary-type-id"": ""f529b476-6e62-324f-b0aa-1f3e33d313fc"",
      ""disambiguation"": """",
      ""secondary-types"": [],
      ""title"": ""Parachutes"",
      ""primary-type"": ""Album""
    },
...
This JSON snippet shows that the first album by Coldplay is Parachutes. It also gives an id, in this case 1dc4c347-a1db-32aa-b14f-bc9cc507b843, which is a unique identifier of the album.
This identifier can be used to make a lookup in the Cover Art Archive API:
http://coverartarchive.org/release-group/1dc4c347-a1db-32aa-b14f-bc9cc507b843. 7
For each album, the JSON response contains some images, one of which is the front cover of the album. The first few lines of the response to the above request:
{
  ""images"": [
    {
      ""approved"": true,

The code to create and visualize the mashup
The overall task is to use Postman to visualize all the album titles and front covers of a music band. How to write code to achieve this has already been described in quite some detail in an answer to the question How can I visualize an API mashup in Postman? – Therefore I will avoid lengthy discussions here and just present the code and a screenshot of the result:
const lock = setTimeout(() => {}, 43210);
const albumsArray = [];
const urlsArray = [];
const urlOuter = 'https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/artist/' +
  pm.collectionVariables.get('MBID') + '?fmt=json&inc=url-rels+release-groups';
pm.sendRequest(urlOuter, (_, responseO) => {
  const bandName = responseO.json().name;
  const albums = responseO.json()['release-groups'];
  for (const item of albums) {
    albumsArray.push(item.title);
    urlsArray.push('https://coverartarchive.org/release-group/' + item.id);
  }
  albumsArray.length = urlsArray.length = 15;
  const images = [];
  let countDown = urlsArray.length;
  urlsArray.forEach((url, index) => {
    asynchronousCall(url, imageURL => {
      images[index] = imageURL;
      if (--countDown === 0) { // Callback for ALL starts on next line.
        clearTimeout(lock); // Unlock the timeout.
        const albumTitles = albumsArray.map(value => ({ title: value }));
        const albumImages = images.map(value => ({ image: value }));
        const albumsAndImages = albumTitles.map(
          (item, i) => Object.assign({}, item, albumImages[i]));
        const template = `<table>
          <tr><th>` + bandName + `</th></tr>
          {{#each responseI}}
          <tr><td>{{title}}<br><img src=""{{image}}""></td></tr>
          {{/each}}
        </table>`;
        pm.visualizer.set(template, { responseI: albumsAndImages });
      }
    });
  });
  function asynchronousCall (url, callback) {
    pm.sendRequest(url, (_, responseI) => {
      callback(responseI.json().images.find(obj => obj.front === true)
        .thumbnails.small); // Individual callback.
    });
  }
});

The result and documentation

How to download and run the Postman Collection
Running the Postman Collection should be straightforward.
Assuming you are using the desktop version of Postman, do as follows:
Download and save
http://henke.atwebpages.com/postman/mbid/MusicBands.pm_coll.json
in a suitable place on your hard drive.
In Postman, Ctrl + O > Upload Files > MusicBands.pm_coll.json > Import.
You should now see MusicBands among your collections in Postman.
Collections > MusicBands > DummyRequest > Send. 8
In the Postman Response Body, click Visualize.
You should now be able to scroll 15 albums as indicated by the screenshot above.

3 The name XMLHttpRequest is as misleading as the X in AJAX – these days the data format of Web APIs is ubiquitously JSON, not XML.
4 Fetch returns a Promise. I was surprised to learn that neither XMLHttpRequest nor Fetch are part of the ECMAScript standard. The reason JavaScript can access them here is because the web browser provides them. The Fetch Standard and the XMLHttpRequest Standard are both upheld by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) that was formed in June 2004.

There is a problem with using promises!
Why should we use our own custom Promise?
I was using this solution for a while until I figured out there is an error in old browsers:
Uncaught ReferenceError: Promise is not defined
So I decided to implement my own Promise class for ES3 to below JavaScript compilers if it's not defined. Just add this code before your main code and then safely use Promise!
if(typeof Promise === ""undefined""){
    function _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) {
        if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) {
            throw new TypeError(""Cannot call a class as a function"");

                _this.value = resolveValue;
                _this.triggerCallbacks();
            };
            var reject = function reject(rejectValue) {
                _this.value = rejectValue;
                _this.triggerCallbacks();
            };
            main(resolve, reject);
        }
        Promise.prototype.then = function then(cb) {
            var _this2 = this;
            var next = new Promise(function (resolve) {
                _this2.callbacks.push(function (x) {
                    return resolve(cb(x));
                });
            });
            return next;
        };
        Promise.prototype.catch = function catch_(cb) {
            var _this2 = this;
            var next = new Promise(function (reject) {
                _this2.callbacks.push(function (x) {

How do I return the response from an asynchronous call?
which can be interpreted as:
How to make asynchronous code look synchronous?
The solution will be to avoid callbacks, and use a combination of Promises and async/await.
I would like to give an example for an Ajax request.
(Although it can be written in JavaScript, I prefer to write it in Python, and compile it to JavaScript using Transcrypt. It will be clear enough.)
Let’s first enable jQuery usage, to have $ available as S:
__pragma__ ('alias', 'S', '$')
Define a function which returns a Promise, in this case an Ajax call:
def read(url: str):
    deferred = S.Deferred()
    S.ajax({'type': ""POST"", 'url': url, 'data': { },
        'success': lambda d: deferred.resolve(d),
        'error': lambda e: deferred.reject(e)
    })
    return deferred.promise()
Use the asynchronous code as if it were synchronous:
async def readALot():
    try:
        result1 = await read(""url_1"")
        result2 = await read(""url_2"")
    except Exception:
        console.warn(""Reading a lot failed"")",2021-04-09 14:09:03Z,31
1313,14220321,Peter Mortensen,63550,"Rather than throwing code at you, there are two concepts that are key to understanding how JavaScript handles callbacks and asynchronicity (is that even a word?)
The Event Loop and Concurrency Model
There are three things you need to be aware of; The queue; the event loop and the stack
In broad, simplistic terms, the event loop is like the project manager, it is constantly listening for any functions that want to run and communicates between the queue and the stack.
while (queue.waitForMessage()) {
  queue.processNextMessage();
}
Once it receives a message to run something it adds it to the queue. The queue is the list of things that are waiting to execute (like your AJAX request). imagine it like this:
call foo.com/api/bar using foobarFunc
Go perform an infinite loop ... and so on
When one of these messages is going to execute it pops the message from the queue and creates a stack, the stack is everything JavaScript needs to execute to perform the instruction in the message. So in our example it's being told to call foobarFunc
function foobarFunc (var) {
  console.log(anotherFunction(var));
}
So anything that foobarFunc needs to execute (in our case anotherFunction) will get pushed onto the stack. executed, and then forgotten about - the event loop will then move onto the next thing in the queue (or listen for messages)
The key thing here is the order of execution. That is
WHEN is something going to run
When you make a call using AJAX to an external party or run any asynchronous code (a setTimeout for example), JavaScript is dependant upon a response before it can proceed.
The big question is when will it get the response? The answer is we don't know - so the event loop is waiting for that message to say ""hey run me"". If JavaScript just waited around for that message synchronously your app would freeze and it will suck. So JavaScript carries on executing the next item in the queue whilst waiting for the message to get added back to the queue.
That's why with asynchronous functionality we use things called callbacks. - A function or handler that, when passed into another function, will be executed at a later date. A promise uses callbacks (functions passed to .then() for example) as a way to reason about this asynchronous behaviour in a more linear way. The promise is a way of saying ""I promise to return something at some point"" and the callback is how we handle that value that is eventually returned. jQuery uses specific callbacks called deffered.done deffered.fail and deffered.always (amongst others). You can see them all here
So what you need to do is pass a function that is promised to execute at some point with data that is passed to it.
Because a callback is not executed immediately but at a later time it's important to pass the reference to the function not it executed. so
function foo(bla) {
  console.log(bla)
}
so most of the time (but not always) you'll pass foo not foo()
Hopefully that will make some sense. When you encounter things like this that seem confusing - i highly recommend reading the documentation fully to at least get an understanding of it. It will make you a much better developer.",2021-04-09 14:43:57Z,29

1342,11563638,VLAZ,3689450,"There are various methods to get an input textbox value directly (without wrapping the input element inside a form element):
Method 1
document.getElementById('textbox_id').value to get the value of desired box
For example
document.getElementById(""searchTxt"").value;
  Note: Method 2,3,4 and 6 returns a collection of elements, so use [whole_number] to get the desired occurrence. For the first element, use [0], for the second one use [1], and so on...
Method 2
Use document.getElementsByClassName('class_name')[whole_number].value which returns a Live HTMLCollection
For example
document.getElementsByClassName(""searchField"")[0].value; if this is the first textbox in your page.
Method 3
Use document.getElementsByTagName('tag_name')[whole_number].value which also returns a live HTMLCollection
For example
document.getElementsByTagName(""input"")[0].value;, if this is the first textbox in your page.
Method 4
document.getElementsByName('name')[whole_number].value which also >returns a live NodeList
For example
document.getElementsByName(""searchTxt"")[0].value; if this is the first textbox with name 'searchtext' in your page.
Method 5
Use the powerful document.querySelector('selector').value which uses a CSS selector to select the element
For example
document.querySelector('#searchTxt').value; selected by id
document.querySelector('.searchField').value; selected by class
document.querySelector('input').value; selected by tagname
document.querySelector('[name=""searchTxt""]').value; selected by name
Method 6
document.querySelectorAll('selector')[whole_number].value which also uses a CSS selector to select elements, but it returns all elements with that selector as a static Nodelist.
For example
document.querySelectorAll('#searchTxt')[0].value; selected by id
document.querySelectorAll('.searchField')[0].value; selected by class
document.querySelectorAll('input')[0].value; selected by tagname
document.querySelectorAll('[name=""searchTxt""]')[0].value; selected by name

If you set the same value for two inputs, then after getElementsByName (or getElementsByTagName ...) you need to remember 0 or 1 is sender or receiver. Later, if you change the order of 2 form in HTML, you need to check this code again

You can get the value of text input field using JavaScript with this code: input_text_value = console.log(document.getElementById(""searchTxt"").value)

textObject has a property of value you can set and get this property.

1391,74583155,O. Jones,205608,"It looks like you want your numeric meta_value results to appear after the non-numeric ones.
In SQL you can simplify your ORDER BY like this.
ORDER BY (meta_value REGEXP '^[0-9]+$'), meta_value DESC
It works because the output of Boolean comparison operations appear a 1 for true and 0 for false.The parentheses aren't strictly necessary but they make the code a bit easier to read.
But, you cannot just stuff this SQL style clause into a WP_Query() object. Replacing the ORDER BY clause is tricky.
Start by converting this into a WP_Query operation. Those things don't look a whole lot like pure SQL. You need something like this, not debugged.
$q = new WP_Query ( 
   ['meta_key' => 'price',
    'order'    => 'DESC',
    'orderby'  => 'meta_value_num',
   ]);
Then you'll get your posts in numeric order by price, with oddball results for non-numeric prices. Run this query and convince yourself you get the posts you want, even if not in the perfect order.
Only then, put a filter handler on the posts_orderby filter to put in your SQLish custom ordering clause. The post you referenced shows how to do that: WordPress Query: ORDER BY CASE WHEN
Use John Blackbourn's Query Monitor plugin to see what your query looks like in real life, after all the WP_Query code finishes assembling it. The correct use of query filters can sometimes be confusing.
If code is poetry then the WP_Query code is an occult spell invocation chant. Sigh.",2022-11-26 15:47:34Z,0

Note: normally a Django model is given a singular name, so Course instead of Courses.
Note: Normally model fields have no prefix with the name of the model. This makes queries longer to read, and often want uses inheritance of (abstract) models to inherit fields, so using a prefix would make it less reusable.

As far as I know, the standard doesn't explicitly say why the concept of undefined behavior exists. In my mind, it's simply because the language designers wanted there to be some leeway in the semantics, instead of i.e. requiring that all implementations handle integer overflow in the exact same way, which would very likely impose serious performance costs, they just left the behavior undefined so that if you write code that causes integer overflow, anything can happen.
So, with that in mind, why are these ""issues""? The language clearly says that certain things lead to undefined behavior. There is no problem, there is no ""should"" involved. If the undefined behavior changes when one of the involved variables is declared volatile, that doesn't prove or change anything. It is undefined; you cannot reason about the behavior.
Your most interesting-looking example, the one with
u = (u++);
is a text-book example of undefined behavior (see Wikipedia's entry on sequence points).",2015-12-16 09:38:33Z,616
1410,949433,Community,-1,"Most of the answers here quoted from C standard emphasizing that the behavior of these constructs are undefined. To understand why the behavior of these constructs are undefined, let's understand these terms first in the light of C11 standard:
Sequenced: (5.1.2.3)
Given any two evaluations A and B, if A is sequenced before B, then the execution of A shall precede the execution of B.
Unsequenced:
If A is not sequenced before or after B, then A and B are unsequenced.
Evaluations can be one of two things:
value computations, which work out the result of an expression; and
side effects, which are modifications of objects.
Sequence Point:
The presence of a sequence point between the evaluation of expressions A and B implies that every value computation and side effect associated with A is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with B.
Now coming to the question, for the expressions like
int i = 1;
i = i++;
standard says that:
6.5 Expressions:
If a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either a different side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of the same scalar object, the behavior is undefined. [...]
Therefore, the above expression invokes UB because two side effects on the same object i is unsequenced relative to each other. That means it is not sequenced whether the side effect by assignment to i will be done before or after the side effect by ++.
Depending on whether assignment occurs before or after the increment, different results will be produced and that's the one of the case of undefined behavior.
Lets rename the i at left of assignment be il and at the right of assignment (in the expression i++) be ir, then the expression be like
il = ir++     // Note that suffix l and r are used for the sake of clarity.
              // Both il and ir represents the same object.  
An important point regarding Postfix ++ operator is that:
just because the ++ comes after the variable does not mean that the increment happens late. The increment can happen as early as the compiler likes as long as the compiler ensures that the original value is used.
It means the expression il = ir++ could be evaluated either as
temp = ir;      // i = 1
ir = ir + 1;    // i = 2   side effect by ++ before assignment
il = temp;      // i = 1   result is 1  
or
temp = ir;      // i = 1
il = temp;      // i = 1   side effect by assignment before ++
ir = ir + 1;    // i = 2   result is 2  
resulting in two different results 1 and 2 which depends on the sequence of side effects by assignment and ++ and hence invokes UB.",2020-06-20 09:12:55Z,91

and 6.5.16 Assignment operators, §4:
The order of evaluation of the operands is unspecified. If an attempt is made to modify the result of an assignment operator or to access it after the next sequence point, the behavior is undefined.",2009-06-04 09:42:43Z,81

1413,949433,Community,-1,"The behavior can't really be explained because it invokes both unspecified behavior and undefined behavior, so we can not make any general predictions about this code, although if you read Olve Maudal's work such as Deep C and Unspecified and Undefined sometimes you can make good guesses in very specific cases with a specific compiler and environment but please don't do that anywhere near production.
So moving on to unspecified behavior, in draft c99 standard section6.5 paragraph 3 says(emphasis mine):
The grouping of operators and operands is indicated by the syntax.74) Except as specified later (for the function-call (), &&, ||, ?:, and comma operators), the order of evaluation of subexpressions and the order in which side effects take place are both unspecified.
So when we have a line like this:
i = i++ + ++i;
we do not know whether i++ or ++i will be evaluated first. This is mainly to give the compiler better options for optimization.
We also have undefined behavior here as well since the program is modifying variables(i, u, etc..) more than once between sequence points. From draft standard section 6.5 paragraph 2(emphasis mine):
Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression. Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value to be stored.
it cites the following code examples as being undefined:
i = ++i + 1;
a[i++] = i; 
In all these examples the code is attempting to modify an object more than once in the same sequence point, which will end with the ; in each one of these cases:
i = i++ + ++i;

i = (i++);

u = u++ + ++u;

Unspecified behavior is defined in the draft c99 standard in section 3.4.4 as:
use of an unspecified value, or other behavior where this International Standard provides two or more possibilities and imposes no further requirements on which is chosen in any instance
and undefined behavior is defined in section 3.4.3 as:
behavior, upon use of a nonportable or erroneous program construct or of erroneous data, for which this International Standard imposes no requirements

Possible undefined behavior ranges from ignoring the situation completely with unpredictable results, to behaving during translation or program execution in a documented manner characteristic of the environment (with or without the issuance of a diagnostic message), to terminating a translation or execution (with the issuance of a diagnostic message).",2017-05-23 12:34:44Z,63
1414,949433,Steve Summit,3923896,"Another way of answering this, rather than getting bogged down in arcane details of sequence points and undefined behavior, is simply to ask, what are they supposed to mean? What was the programmer trying to do?
The first fragment asked about, i = i++ + ++i, is pretty clearly insane in my book. No one would ever write it in a real program, it's not obvious what it does, there's no conceivable algorithm someone could have been trying to code that would have resulted in this particular contrived sequence of operations. And since it's not obvious to you and me what it's supposed to do, it's fine in my book if the compiler can't figure out what it's supposed to do, either.
The second fragment, i = i++, is a little easier to understand. Someone is clearly trying to increment i, and assign the result back to i. But there are a couple ways of doing this in C. The most basic way to add 1 to i, and assign the result back to i, is the same in almost any programming language:
i = i + 1
C, of course, has a handy shortcut:
i++
This means, ""add 1 to i, and assign the result back to i"". So if we construct a hodgepodge of the two, by writing
i = i++
what we're really saying is ""add 1 to i, and assign the result back to i, and assign the result back to i"". We're confused, so it doesn't bother me too much if the compiler gets confused, too.
Realistically, the only time these crazy expressions get written is when people are using them as artificial examples of how ++ is supposed to work. And of course it is important to understand how ++ works. But one practical rule for using ++ is, ""If it's not obvious what an expression using ++ means, don't write it.""
We used to spend countless hours on comp.lang.c discussing expressions like these and why they're undefined. Two of my longer answers, that try to really explain why, are archived on the web:
Why doesn't the Standard define what these do?
Doesn't operator precedence determine the order of evaluation?

1415,949433,Felipe Augusto,7385033,"Often this question is linked as a duplicate of questions related to code like
printf(""%d %d\n"", i, i++);
or
printf(""%d %d\n"", ++i, i++);
or similar variants.
While this is also undefined behaviour as stated already, there are subtle differences when printf() is involved when comparing to a statement such as:
x = i++ + i++;
In the following statement:
printf(""%d %d\n"", ++i, i++);
the order of evaluation of arguments in printf() is unspecified. That means, expressions i++ and ++i could be evaluated in any order. C11 standard has some relevant descriptions on this:
Annex J, unspecified behaviours
The order in which the function designator, arguments, and subexpressions within the arguments are evaluated in a function call (6.5.2.2).
3.4.4, unspecified behavior
Use of an unspecified value, or other behavior where this International Standard provides two or more possibilities and imposes no further requirements on which is chosen in any instance.
EXAMPLE An example of unspecified behavior is the order in which the arguments to a function are evaluated.
The unspecified behaviour itself is NOT an issue. Consider this example:
printf(""%d %d\n"", ++x, y++);
This too has unspecified behaviour because the order of evaluation of ++x and y++ is unspecified. But it's perfectly legal and valid statement. There's no undefined behaviour in this statement. Because the modifications (++x and y++) are done to distinct objects.
What renders the following statement
printf(""%d %d\n"", ++i, i++);
as undefined behaviour is the fact that these two expressions modify the same object i without an intervening sequence point.
Another detail is that the comma involved in the printf() call is a separator, not the comma operator.
This is an important distinction because the comma operator does introduce a sequence point between the evaluation of their operands, which makes the following legal:
int i = 5;
int j;

j = (++i, i++);  // No undefined behaviour here because the comma operator 
                 // introduces a sequence point between '++i' and 'i++'

printf(""i=%d j=%d\n"",i, j); // prints: i=7 j=6
The comma operator evaluates its operands left-to-right and yields only the value of the last operand. So in j = (++i, i++);, ++i increments i to 6 and i++ yields old value of i (6) which is assigned to j. Then i becomes 7 due to post-increment.
So if the comma in the function call were to be a comma operator then
printf(""%d %d\n"", ++i, i++);
will not be a problem. But it invokes undefined behaviour because the comma here is a separator.
For those who are new to undefined behaviour would benefit from reading What Every C Programmer Should Know About Undefined Behavior to understand the concept and many other variants of undefined behaviour in C.

1416,949433,supercat,363751,"While it is unlikely that any compilers and processors would actually do so, it would be legal, under the C standard, for the compiler to implement ""i++"" with the sequence:
In a single operation, read `i` and lock it to prevent access until further notice
Compute (1+read_value)
In a single operation, unlock `i` and store the computed value
While I don't think any processors support the hardware to allow such a thing to be done efficiently, one can easily imagine situations where such behavior would make multi-threaded code easier (e.g. it would guarantee that if two threads try to perform the above sequence simultaneously, i would get incremented by two) and it's not totally inconceivable that some future processor might provide a feature something like that.
If the compiler were to write i++ as indicated above (legal under the standard) and were to intersperse the above instructions throughout the evaluation of the overall expression (also legal), and if it didn't happen to notice that one of the other instructions happened to access i, it would be possible (and legal) for the compiler to generate a sequence of instructions that would deadlock. To be sure, a compiler would almost certainly detect the problem in the case where the same variable i is used in both places, but if a routine accepts references to two pointers p and q, and uses (*p) and (*q) in the above expression (rather than using i twice) the compiler would not be required to recognize or avoid the deadlock that would occur if the same object's address were passed for both p and q.",2017-10-23 20:06:36Z,23

The following are the sequence points described in 5.1.2.3:

Between the evaluations of the first and second operands of the following operators: logical AND && (6.5.13); logical OR || (6.5.14); comma , (6.5.17).
Between the evaluations of the first operand of the conditional ? : operator and whichever of the second and third operands is evaluated (6.5.15).
The end of a full declarator: declarators (6.7.6);
Between the evaluation of a full expression and the next full expression to be evaluated. The following are full expressions: an initializer that is not part of a compound literal (6.7.9); the expression in an expression statement (6.8.3); the controlling expression of a selection statement (if or switch) (6.8.4); the controlling expression of a while or do statement (6.8.5); each of the (optional) expressions of a for statement (6.8.5.3); the (optional) expression in a return statement (6.8.6.4).
Immediately before a library function returns (7.1.4).
After the actions associated with each formatted input/output function conversion specifier (7.21.6, 7.29.2).
Immediately before and immediately after each call to a comparison function, and also between any call to a comparison function and any movement of the objects passed as arguments to that call (7.22.5).
The wording of the same paragraph in C11 is:
If a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either a different side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of the same scalar object, the behavior is undefined. If there are multiple allowable orderings of the subexpressions of an expression, the behavior is undefined if such an unsequenced side effect occurs in any of the orderings.84)

cc1: all warnings being treated as errors
The important part is to know what a sequence point is -- and what is a sequence point and what isn't. For example the comma operator is a sequence point, so
j = (i ++, ++ i);
is well-defined, and will increment i by one, yielding the old value, discard that value; then at comma operator, settle the side effects; and then increment i by one, and the resulting value becomes the value of the expression - i.e. this is just a contrived way to write j = (i += 2) which is yet again a ""clever"" way to write
i += 2;
j = i;
However, the , in function argument lists is not a comma operator, and there is no sequence point between evaluations of distinct arguments; instead their evaluations are unsequenced with regard to each other; so the function call
int i = 0;
printf(""%d %d\n"", i++, ++i, i);
has undefined behaviour because there is no sequence point between the evaluations of i++ and ++i in function arguments, and the value of i is therefore modified twice, by both i++ and ++i, between the previous and the next sequence point.",2018-09-07 12:49:14Z,18

This answer tries to answer that question: why did your code not give you the answer you expected, and how can you learn to recognize (and avoid) expressions that will not work as expected.
I assume you've heard the basic definition of C's ++ and -- operators by now, and how the prefix form ++x differs from the postfix form x++. But these operators are hard to think about, so to make sure you understood, perhaps you wrote a tiny little test program involving something like
int x = 5;
printf(""%d %d %d\n"", x, ++x, x++);
But, to your surprise, this program did not help you understand — it printed some strange, inexplicable output, suggesting that maybe ++ does something completely different, not at all what you thought it did.
Or, perhaps you're looking at a hard-to-understand expression like
int x = 5;
x = x++ + ++x;
printf(""%d\n"", x);
Perhaps someone gave you that code as a puzzle. This code also makes no sense, especially if you run it — and if you compile and run it under two different compilers, you're likely to get two different answers! What's up with that? Which answer is correct? (And the answer is that both of them are, or neither of them are.)
As you've heard by now, these expressions are undefined, which means that the C language makes no guarantee about what they'll do. This is a strange and unsettling result, because you probably thought that any program you could write, as long as it compiled and ran, would generate a unique, well-defined output. But in the case of undefined behavior, that's not so.
What makes an expression undefined? Are expressions involving ++ and -- always undefined? Of course not: these are useful operators, and if you use them properly, they're perfectly well-defined.
For the expressions we're talking about, what makes them undefined is when there's too much going on at once, when we can't tell what order things will happen in, but when the order matters to the result we'll get.
Let's go back to the two examples I've used in this answer. When I wrote
printf(""%d %d %d\n"", x, ++x, x++);
the question is, before actually calling printf, does the compiler compute the value of x first, or x++, or maybe ++x? But it turns out we don't know. There's no rule in C which says that the arguments to a function get evaluated left-to-right, or right-to-left, or in some other order. So we can't say whether the compiler will do x first, then ++x, then x++, or x++ then ++x then x, or some other order. But the order clearly matters, because depending on which order the compiler uses, we'll clearly get a different series of numbers printed out.
What about this crazy expression?
x = x++ + ++x;
The problem with this expression is that it contains three different attempts to modify the value of x: (1) the x++ part tries to take x's value, add 1, store the new value in x, and return the old value; (2) the ++x part tries to take x's value, add 1, store the new value in x, and return the new value; and (3) the x = part tries to assign the sum of the other two back to x. Which of those three attempted assignments will ""win""? Which of the three values will actually determine the final value of x? Again, and perhaps surprisingly, there's no rule in C to tell us.
You might imagine that precedence or associativity or left-to-right evaluation tells you what order things happen in, but they do not. You may not believe me, but please take my word for it, and I'll say it again: precedence and associativity do not determine every aspect of the evaluation order of an expression in C. In particular, if within one expression there are multiple different spots where we try to assign a new value to something like x, precedence and associativity do not tell us which of those attempts happens first, or last, or anything.
So with all that background and introduction out of the way, if you want to make sure that all your programs are well-defined, which expressions can you write, and which ones can you not write?
These expressions are all fine:
y = x++;
z = x++ + y++;
x = x + 1;
x = a[i++];
x = a[i++] + b[j++];
x[i++] = a[j++] + b[k++];
x = *p++;
x = *p++ + *q++;
These expressions are all undefined:
x = x++;
x = x++ + ++x;
y = x + x++;
a[i] = i++;
a[i++] = i;
printf(""%d %d %d\n"", x, ++x, x++);
And the last question is, how can you tell which expressions are well-defined, and which expressions are undefined?
As I said earlier, the undefined expressions are the ones where there's too much going at once, where you can't be sure what order things happen in, and where the order matters:
If there's one variable that's getting modified (assigned to) in two or more different places, how do you know which modification happens first?
If there's a variable that's getting modified in one place, and having its value used in another place, how do you know whether it uses the old value or the new value?
As an example of #1, in the expression
x = x++ + ++x;
there are three attempts to modify x.
As an example of #2, in the expression
y = x + x++;
we both use the value of x, and modify it.
So that's the answer: make sure that in any expression you write, each variable is modified at most once, and if a variable is modified, you don't also attempt to use the value of that variable somewhere else.
One more thing. You might be wondering how to ""fix"" the undefined expressions I started this answer by presenting.
In the case of printf(""%d %d %d\n"", x, ++x, x++);, it's easy — just write it as three separate printf calls:
printf(""%d "", x);
printf(""%d "", ++x);
printf(""%d\n"", x++);
Now the behavior is perfectly well defined, and you'll get sensible results.
In the case of x = x++ + ++x, on the other hand, there's no way to fix it. There's no way to write it so that it has guaranteed behavior matching your expectations — but that's okay, because you would never write an expression like x = x++ + ++x in a real program anyway.",2022-01-29 13:19:57Z,11
1421,949433,alinsoar,1419272,"A good explanation about what happens in this kind of computation is provided in the document n1188 from the ISO W14 site.
I explain the ideas.
The main rule from the standard ISO 9899 that applies in this situation is 6.5p2.
Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression. Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value to be stored.
The sequence points in an expression like i=i++ are before i= and after i++.
In the paper that I quoted above it is explained that you can figure out the program as being formed by small boxes, each box containing the instructions between 2 consecutive sequence points. The sequence points are defined in annex C of the standard, in the case of i=i++ there are 2 sequence points that delimit a full-expression. Such an expression is syntactically equivalent with an entry of expression-statement in the Backus-Naur form of the grammar (a grammar is provided in annex A of the Standard).
So the order of instructions inside a box has no clear order.
i=i++
can be interpreted as
tmp = i
i=i+1
i = tmp
or as
tmp = i
i = tmp
i=i+1
because both all these forms to interpret the code i=i++ are valid and because both generate different answers, the behavior is undefined.
So a sequence point can be seen by the beginning and the end of each box that composes the program [the boxes are atomic units in C] and inside a box the order of instructions is not defined in all cases. Changing that order one can change the result sometimes.
EDIT:
Other good source for explaining such ambiguities are the entries from c-faq site (also published as a book) , namely here and here and here .",2017-11-24 12:15:14Z,6
1422,949433,VLL,2527795,"The reason is that the program is running undefined behavior. The problem lies in the evaluation order, because there is no sequence points required according to C++98 standard ( no operations is sequenced before or after another according to C++11 terminology).
However if you stick to one compiler, you will find the behavior persistent, as long as you don't add function calls or pointers, which would make the behavior more messy.
Using Nuwen MinGW 15 GCC 7.1 you will get:
 #include<stdio.h>
 int main(int argc, char ** argv)
 {
    int i = 0;
    i = i++ + ++i;
    printf(""%d\n"", i); // 2

    i = 1;
    i = (i++);
    printf(""%d\n"", i); //1

    volatile int u = 0;
    u = u++ + ++u;
    printf(""%d\n"", u); // 2

    u = 1;
    u = (u++);
    printf(""%d\n"", u); //1

    register int v = 0;
    v = v++ + ++v;
    printf(""%d\n"", v); //2
 }
How does GCC work? it evaluates sub expressions at a left to right order for the right hand side (RHS) , then assigns the value to the left hand side (LHS) . This is exactly how Java and C# behave and define their standards. (Yes, the equivalent software in Java and C# has defined behaviors). It evaluate each sub expression one by one in the RHS Statement in a left to right order; for each sub expression: the ++c (pre-increment) is evaluated first then the value c is used for the operation, then the post increment c++).
according to GCC C++: Operators
In GCC C++, the precedence of the operators controls the order in which the individual operators are evaluated
the equivalent code in defined behavior C++ as GCC understands:
#include<stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char ** argv)
{
    int i = 0;
    //i = i++ + ++i;
    int r;
    r=i;
    i++;
    ++i;
    r+=i;
    i=r;
    printf(""%d\n"", i); // 2

    i = 1;
    //i = (i++);
    r=i;
    i++;
    i=r;
    printf(""%d\n"", i); // 1

    volatile int u = 0;
    //u = u++ + ++u;
    r=u;
    u++;
    ++u;
    r+=u;
    u=r;
    printf(""%d\n"", u); // 2

    u = 1;
    //u = (u++);
    r=u;
    u++;
    u=r;
    printf(""%d\n"", u); // 1

    register int v = 0;
    //v = v++ + ++v;
    r=v;
    v++;
    ++v;
    r+=v;
    v=r;
    printf(""%d\n"", v); //2
}
Then we go to Visual Studio. Visual Studio 2015, you get:
#include<stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char ** argv)
{
    int i = 0;
    i = i++ + ++i;
    printf(""%d\n"", i); // 3

    i = 1;
    i = (i++);
    printf(""%d\n"", i); // 2 

    volatile int u = 0;
    u = u++ + ++u;
    printf(""%d\n"", u); // 3

    u = 1;
    u = (u++);
    printf(""%d\n"", u); // 2 

    register int v = 0;
    v = v++ + ++v;
    printf(""%d\n"", v); // 3 
}
How does Visual Studio work, it takes another approach, it evaluates all pre-increments expressions in first pass, then uses variables values in the operations in second pass, assign from RHS to LHS in third pass, then at last pass it evaluates all the post-increment expressions in one pass.
So the equivalent in defined behavior C++ as Visual C++ understands:
#include<stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char ** argv)
{
    int r;
    int i = 0;
    //i = i++ + ++i;
    ++i;
    r = i + i;
    i = r;
    i++;
    printf(""%d\n"", i); // 3

    i = 1;
    //i = (i++);
    r = i;

The model overfits when the training loss is decreasing (or remains the same) but the validation loss gradually increases without decreasing. This is clearly not the case
So, what you can do:
Try training longer.
Add more layers.
Try different activation functions like ReLU instead of tanh.
Use lower dropout (probably your model is struggling to learn for high value of dropouts).

1439,74583083,Nicol Bolas,734069,"The ""await"" style of coroutines is intended for doing asynchronous processing in a way that mirrors the synchronous equivalent. In sinchronous code, you might write:
int func(float f)
{
   auto value = compute_stuff(f);
   auto val2 = compute_more_stuff(value, 23);
   return val2 + value;
}
If one or both of these functions is asychronous, you would rewrite it as follows (assuming the presence of appropriate co_await machinery):
task<int> func(float f)
{
   auto value = compute_stuff(f);
   auto val2 = co_await async_compute_more_stuff(value, 23);
   co_return val2 + value;
}
It's structurally the same code except that in one case, func will halt halfway through until async_compute_more_stuff has finished its computation, then be resumed and return its value through Task<int>. The async nature of the code is as implicit as possible; it largely looks like synchronous code.
If you already have some extant async process, and you just want a function to get called when that process concludes, and there is no direct relationship between them, you don't need a coroutine. This code:
static atomic<bool> example_global_predicate;
auto coro = []() -> Task {
  while (!example_global_predicate)
    co_await std::suspend_always();
  /* example_global_predicate is now true, do stuff */
  co_return;
}();
Is not meaningfully different from this:
static atomic<bool> example_global_predicate;

register_polling_task([]() -> bool
{
  if(!example_global_predicate)
     return false;
  /* example_global_predicate is now true, do stuff */
  return true;
});
register_polling_task represents some global construct which will at regular intervals call your function until it returns true, at which point it assumes that it has done its job and removes the task. Your coroutine version might hide this global construct, but it still needs to be there because somebody has to wake the coroutine up.
Overall, this is not an async circumstance where using coroutines buys you anything in particular.
However, it could still be theoretically useful to attach coroutine resumption to a polling task. The most reasonable way to do this is to put the polling in a task outside of a coroutine. That is, coroutines shouldn't poll for the global state; that's someone else's job.
A coroutine would do something like co_await PollingTask(). This hands the coroutine_handle off to the system that polls the global state. When that global state enters the correct state, it will resume that handle. And when executing the co_await expression, it should also check the state then, so that if the state is already signaled, it should just not halt the coroutine's execution.
PollingTask() would return an awaitable that has all of this machinery built into it.",2022-11-26 20:41:11Z,0

A bit of historic context: Alongside the ""Modern"" UI platform, Windows 8 introduced a variation of the STA, the Application STA (wildly undocumented1, no surprises there). Windows 10 finally exposed the ""Modern"" UI platform (still unnamed) through Windows Runtime types under the Windows.UI.Xaml namespace. (Most) of those types will want to be accessed from the ASTA (which is apparently enforced at run time, evidenced by the RPC_E_WRONG_THREAD ""exception"").
Fast forward to today, the ""Modern"" UI platform mostly gone, together with its clean design language. The UWP sharing a coffin with Windows 10 Mobile, and the ASTA history, too. WinUI 3 has come full circle, ultimately supporting the classic Desktop application model only, back to the classic COM threading architecture: Zero or one MTA, and any number of STAs.
No ASTA, anywhere.
After that bit of a detour it should be easy to understand, what the issue is: The code is trying to access objects designed for the ASTA from a regular STA thread.
The solution is pretty straight forward, too: Replace all types from the Windows.UI.Xaml namespace with their WinUI 3 twins from the Microsoft.UI.Xaml namespace:
In the IDL for WordArray make sure to derive from Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Data.INotifyPropertyChanged rather than Windows.UI.Xaml.Data.INotifyPropertyChanged
Change the type parameter for the winrt::event class template from Windows::UI::Xaml::Data::PropertyChangedEventHandler to Microsoft::UI::Xaml::Data::PropertyChangedEventHandler and update the PropertyChanged implementations to use the this type
Construct a Microsoft::UI::Xaml::Data::PropertyChangedEventArgs object instead of a Windows::UI::Xaml::Data::PropertyChangedEventArgs object when raising events
To do this you will also have to update the respective #include directives that reference <winrt/Windows.UI.Xaml. ... .h> header files to use <winrt/Microsoft.UI.Xaml. ... .h> instead, and replace any using namespace directives accordingly.

I guess return type should be a List<Room> (not a list of Hotel). Think about it this way: when need to find a place to stay, you are not going to book the whole hotel, you need a room instead. There's no need for searchHotelRoom() generate new Hotel instances based on the rooms that match the criteria, we need the rooms itself.
You might want to retain the information to which Hotel a certain Room belongs, this problem can be (and should be) addressed on the class-design level. For that, you can introduce a property to the Room class. For instance: String hotelName, or alternatively a room could hold a reference to the instance of Hotel, but in such case you need to be careful while implementing methods like toString() and hashCode() because you might end up with infinite recursion.
So, to get a List of Rooms that match the given criteria, you need to apply a hotel-related filter and then transform a stream of hotels Stream<Hotel> into a stream of rooms Stream<Room>. For that, you can use flatMap() operation (or Java 16 mapMulti()), which is meant to perform one-to-many transformation and expects a function producing a Stream as an argument.
Then a room-related filter, and collect the result.
Note that instead of applying filter() twice you can chain the predicates using Precate.and() which is an equivalent of the logical AND &&.
public static List<Room> searchHotelRoom(List<Hotel> hotelList, String city, int start, Double priceMax, int nbBed) {
    
    //condition about city location and price on hotel list
    Predicate<Hotel> byCity = !city.isEmpty()? hotel -> hotel.getCity().equalsIgnoreCase(city) : hotel -> true;
    Predicate<Hotel> byStart = !(start == 0)? hotel -> hotel.getNumberOfStart() == start:hotel -> true;
    
    //condition on room list
    Predicate<Room> byNbBed = !(nbBed == 0)? room  -> (room.getNumberOfBed() == nbBed) :room -> false;
    Predicate<Room> byPrice = room ->  room.getPrice() <= priceMax;
    
    return hotelList.stream()                        // Stream<Hotel>
        .filter(byStart.and(byCity))
        .flatMap(hotel -> hotel.getRooms().stream()) // Stream<Room>
        .filter(byPrice.and(byNbBed))
        .toList(); // for Java 16 or collect(Collectors.toList())
}",2022-11-26 15:31:48Z,2
1500,74583003,Edward Peters,6016064,"You need to use a map (or flatmap) as well as a filter to do something like this. The rough form will be something like:
hotelsList.stream()
    .filter(hotelFilter)
    .flatMap(hotel -> hotel.rooms.stream()
        .filter(roomFilter))
    .collect(whatever)
In general, map operations take an A<B> and a B -> C and give you a A<C>. Flatmaps take an A<B> and a B -> A<C> and give you an A<C> (for instance, combining lists, but also performing an operation on an Optional that might itself return None even if the original value existed)",2022-11-26 14:53:09Z,2
1501,74583003,Ben Anderson,14844306,"Due to the fact that other answers have already suggested how the problem can be solved by modifying the Room class (or just returning a List of Rooms), I'd like to suggest a solution that doesn't modify it, whilst maintaining the relationship between a Room and a Hotel.
For the method Main#searchHotelRoom, you could use Collectors.toMap and return Map<Hotel, List<Room>> which denotes a map of Hotels against a List of Rooms that met the search criteria for that Hotel.
Here is an example of how you could achieve this:
return hotelList.stream()
                .filter(byStart)
                .filter(byCity)
                .collect(

                                      .filter(byPrice)

        this.refHotel = refHotel;
    }

    public Hotel getRefHotel() {
        return refHotel;

        //condition on room list
        Predicate<Room> byNbBed =!(nbBed==0)? room -> room.getNumberOfBed() == nbBed:room -> true;
        Predicate<Room> byPrice = room ->  room.getPrice()<=priceMax;

       return rooms.stream()
                .filter(byStart.and(byCity))
                .filter(byPrice.and(byNbBed))

The whole problem stems from the fact that jest does not yet (as of writing this post) fully support node ESM mode and whenever a esModule is being loaded, jest cannot interpret it correctly.
The other issue is that in the Next.js distribution version there is the next/dist/build/jest/jest.js file that prevents from overriding testPathIgnorePatterns configuration option.
Considering both of the issues, you either have to use:
NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules with jest
this loads ESM modules but you can't properly use jest.mock which I've described here.
or the second option is to hack around next.js jest config file described here
This allows for transpiling ESM modules before running the tests which is the option I went for.",2022-11-26 16:46:42Z,0

1518,74582964,Kai - Kazuya Ito,8172439,"The reason you are seeing the issue, is that the thread is still within the while loop when i moves from 5 to 6. The thread seems to obtain lock before the value is updated. i.e. The speed of release and lock is quicker than the assignment of i. So the thread goes through one more round, but the only check you have is if the owner is equal to A or B. So you have to once again have the check in place to test that i<=5.
If you had a single thread, then you would not have this issue, but because you are using two threads, you have to think of them as different entities, doing their own jobs. While i is being updated in one thread, the other thread is still spinning and checking, locking and unlocking.

The best way to visualise the thread actions is to have print statements within the lock (before the if-statement) - to see what each thread is up to.
import threading
lock = threading.Lock()
owner = ""A""
i = 0

def test1():

Let say you have this snippet code:
let a = 1
b = a + 1
The code runs just fine, but with minify, it strips out all space, line break... Then the code become this:
let a=1b=a+1
This is not a valid javascript anymore => Error only happens with minified code
Source map is what helps you link your minified code to the source code. It helps you easier to debug when developing in your local computer, or even production code, where you have minified code only. But that's another story.
Bottom line is SourceMap won't help you fix any error, the error still shows up, but SourceMap helps you read the code easier.
To know where's the problem occurs, it requires your debug technique, set a breakpoint, trace down the code, or ""pause on exception""...

SQL divides the JSON result into chunks 2k in size (at least my SQL 2016 installation does), one chunk in the first column of each row in the result set. To get the entire result, your client code has to loop through the result set and concatenate the first column of each record. When you've gotten to the end of the rows, voila, your entire JSON result is retrieved, uncut.
When I first encountered the truncation problem I was baffled, and wrote off FOR JSON for several years as an unserious feature suited only to the smallest of datasets. I learned that I need to read the entire recordset only from the FOR XML documentation, and never actually saw it mentioned in the FOR JSON docs.",2021-06-21 21:25:46Z,5

1656,74582745,Sweeper,5133585,"While in most cases, constructors can be replaced by required, I can think of some obvious, albeit relatively uncommon, cases where you would still need to use constructors.
Specialising a required property in a derived class so that it is not required
This is disallowed by design. The override of a required property must also be required, whereas derived class constructors can easily ""remove"" a parameter from a base class constructor, like:
public BaseClass(string p) { }

public DerivedClass(): base(""some default value"") { }
If you want to do something like that with required, you cannot :(
Where the properties are less visible than the enclosing type
Required properties can only be at least as visible as their enclosing type. This means if your class is public, no internal, protected or private required properties for you!
On the other hand, constructors can initialise properties of all access levels.
Where the initialisation isn't one-to-one
If you have a situation where the initialisation of the properties depends on multiple different parameters, like
public MyClass(string p1, string p2, string p3) {
    this.Property1 = MakeSomethingFrom(p1, p2);
    this.Property2 = MakeSomethingElseFrom(p2, p3);
}
then I don't think it is possible (or at least it is very hard) to rewrite it with required. I cannot think of how one can do it.
Another way of explaining this case is when you don't want to store an initialisation parameter in a field/property - you just want to do something with it, and discard it. That is when constructors are more suitable, since required can only be applied to fields and properties.",2022-11-26 14:35:13Z,1

That will print the following tree:
That is a tree that uses up to three levels of splits and still does not find a perfect fit. The first split has a p-value of .2, indicating that there is not nearly enough data to justify even this first split, let alone those following it. This is a tree that is very likely to massively overfit the data and overfitting is bad. That is why usual tree algorithms come with measures to prevent overfitting and in your case, that prohibits growing a tree. I disabled those with the arguments in the ctree call.
So in short: You have not enough data. Just predicting - all the time is the most reasonable thing a classification tree can do.",2022-11-26 17:19:12Z,1

You are correct. The compiler complains that you are calling a function for which it has not seen a declaration. Including <stdlib.h> does provide a proper declaration for the function calloc. Note that you could also have provided a declaration yourself by adding the line: void *calloc(size_t, size_t);. Yet it is recommended to use the standard include files to get the exact declarations for library functions.
Why doesn't the GCC give an error?
Because the compiler is lenient in order to compile older programs that were written before the C Standard was even published. It used to not be an error to call functions without a declaration or a definition in scope. The compiler would just infer the prototype from the types of the arguments provided. In your case the prototype is inferred as int calloc(int, size_t), which is obviously incorrect and will cause undefined behavior. To avoid such problems, the compiler issues a warning about calloc being undeclared.
Why does my program still know what is calloc?
It does not, the prototype is inferred from the call statement and this guess falls short. As a matter of fact, the compiler should also complain about the int return value being implicitly converted to an int * when stored to arr. If int * and int have a different representation on the target system (as is the case on 64-bit systems), the value of arr will be invalid and free(arr) will definitely have undefined behavior too. The compiler produces an executable because the function calloc is found in the C library, which is linked to all C programs implicitly.
Should we close our eyes at the warning?
Definitely not. You should compile your program with all warnings enabled using gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror, and gcc will consider all warnings like fatal errors and refuse to produce an executable until they are corrected. This will save you many hours of debugging time. It is a pity this behavior is not the default one.
my program works well even without include of <stdlib.h>.
Well it appears to work on your system, but it fails on mine (assuming I remove my default compiler options that prevent gcc from making an executable). The program has undefined behavior. Do not rely on chance.
Here is a proper version:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *arr = calloc(1, sizeof(*arr));  /* use object type for consistency */

    printf(""pointer value is %p\n"", (void *)arr);

    free(arr);
    return 0;
}",2022-11-26 14:11:12Z,2
1743,74582606,chrslg,20037042,"calloc is not in stdlib.h. Nothing is in stdlib.h. Nothing is in any .h (or nothing should).
What is in stdlib.h is just (about calloc I mean)
extern void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size);
calloc is in the libc. That is where your program will find it when it will call it.
Strictly speaking, you don't need anything else (I mean, from an execution point of view) to be able to call a function.
All .c codes are compiled to do their task. libc has been compiled long ago. And at linking time (for static libraries, and for dynamic to point to them) and then at run time, all functions from all compiled code are loaded. So your main from your code and calloc will find each other at that time.
The problem is not there.
The problem is that in order to compile your main, the compiler need to know how calloc is supposed to be called.
It needs to know it to check for syntax error. Otherwise you could pass 3 arguments, or only one, to calloc, and the compiler would have no way to know that this is not correct. You could pass arguments of the wrong type, and likewise.
It needs to know also to know how many bytes it is supposed to push as an argument, and even how it is supposed to pass arguments.
See for example these two codes
one.c
#include <stdio.h>

void printInt(int a, int b){
    printf(""ints %d %d\n"", a, b);
}

void printFloat(float a, float b){
    printf(""floats %f %f\n"", a, b);
}

void printDouble(double a, double b){
    printf(""doubles %f %f\n"", a, b);
}
two.c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    printInt(1,2);
    printInt(1.0, 2.0);

    printFloat(1,2);
    printFloat(1.0,2.0);

    printDouble(1,2);
    printDouble(1.0,2.0);
}
Compile them with (depending on your compiler)
gcc -std=gnu99 -o main one.c two.c # There is an implicit -lc here including libc, that contains printf
On my computer it prints
ints 1 2
ints 1034078176 -2098396512
floats 0.000000 0.000000
floats 0.000000 0.000000
doubles 0.000000 0.000000
doubles 1.000000 2.000000
See that it works as intended only for printInt called with ints, and printDouble called with doubles. It fails to cast 1.0 as an int to call printInt, or on the contrary to cast 1 as a double to call printDouble. And For printFloat it fails in all cases, because the compiler assumed wrongly the size of the arguments to be pushed.
But other than that, those 3 functions are called. It is not the the code of the function that is missing. It is the ability of the compiler, when calling them, to call them correctly.
Just add, in two.c the declarations
extern void printInt(int, int);
extern void printFloat(float, float);
extern void printDouble(double, double);
(Or create a one.h containing those, and #include ""one.h"" in two.c, it leads to the same result)
And now the output is as expected
ints 1 2
ints 1 2
floats 1.000000 2.000000
floats 1.000000 2.000000
doubles 1.000000 2.000000
doubles 1.000000 2.000000
And I haven't even started with types declarations.
#include are not meant to provide libraries, and the functions that are in them. That you do while linking, adding .o and -lsomelib to the liking command line (or using other way, depending on your compiler).
#include are there to provide codeless declarations that the compiler needs to know how to call those functions.",2022-11-26 14:15:56Z,1

If you tried to call a made up function, you also wouldn't get a compiler error, rather your linker would complain about being unable to resolve a symbol.
You technically can, but you absolutely shouldn't. If you wouldn't you wouldn't be warned about argument errors. The Linker does not (and can not) check, if you supplied the right amount and types of arguments.
Example:
// a.c
int asdf(int b){
   return b+1;
}

// main.c
int main(void) {
   asdf();

1757,14220321,Nick Parsons,5648954,"→ For a more general explanation of asynchronous behaviour with different examples, see Why is my variable unaltered after I modify it inside of a function? - Asynchronous code reference
→ If you already understand the problem, skip to the possible solutions below.
The problem
The A in Ajax stands for asynchronous. That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, $.ajax returns immediately and the next statement, return result;, is executed before the function you passed as success callback was even called.
Here is an analogy which hopefully makes the difference between synchronous and asynchronous flow clearer:
Synchronous
Imagine you make a phone call to a friend and ask him to look something up for you. Although it might take a while, you wait on the phone and stare into space, until your friend gives you the answer that you needed.
The same is happening when you make a function call containing ""normal"" code:
function findItem() {
    var item;
    while(item_not_found) {
        // search
    }
    return item;
}

var item = findItem();

// Do something with item
doSomethingElse();
Even though findItem might take a long time to execute, any code coming after var item = findItem(); has to wait until the function returns the result.
Asynchronous
You call your friend again for the same reason. But this time you tell him that you are in a hurry and he should call you back on your mobile phone. You hang up, leave the house, and do whatever you planned to do. Once your friend calls you back, you are dealing with the information he gave to you.
That's exactly what's happening when you do an Ajax request.
findItem(function(item) {
    // Do something with the item
});
doSomethingElse();
Instead of waiting for the response, the execution continues immediately and the statement after the Ajax call is executed. To get the response eventually, you provide a function to be called once the response was received, a callback (notice something? call back ?). Any statement coming after that call is executed before the callback is called.
Solution(s)
Embrace the asynchronous nature of JavaScript! While certain asynchronous operations provide synchronous counterparts (so does ""Ajax""), it's generally discouraged to use them, especially in a browser context.
Why is it bad do you ask?
JavaScript runs in the UI thread of the browser and any long-running process will lock the UI, making it unresponsive. Additionally, there is an upper limit on the execution time for JavaScript and the browser will ask the user whether to continue the execution or not.
All of this results in a really bad user experience. The user won't be able to tell whether everything is working fine or not. Furthermore, the effect will be worse for users with a slow connection.
In the following we will look at three different solutions that are all building on top of each other:
Promises with async/await (ES2017+, available in older browsers if you use a transpiler or regenerator)
Callbacks (popular in node)
Promises with then() (ES2015+, available in older browsers if you use one of the many promise libraries)
All three are available in current browsers, and node 7+.
ES2017+: Promises with async/await
The ECMAScript version released in 2017 introduced syntax-level support for asynchronous functions. With the help of async and await, you can write asynchronous in a ""synchronous style"". The code is still asynchronous, but it's easier to read/understand.
async/await builds on top of promises: an async function always returns a promise. await ""unwraps"" a promise and either result in the value the promise was resolved with or throws an error if the promise was rejected.
Important: You can only use await inside an async function or in a JavaScript module. Top-level await is not supported outside of modules, so you might have to make an async IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to start an async context if not using a module.
You can read more about async and await on MDN.
Here is an example that elaborates the delay function findItem() above:
// Using 'superagent' which will return a promise.
var superagent = require('superagent')

// This is isn't declared as `async` because it already returns a promise
function delay() {
  // `delay` returns a promise
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // Only `delay` is able to resolve or reject the promise
    setTimeout(function() {
      resolve(42); // After 3 seconds, resolve the promise with value 42
    }, 3000);
  });
}

async function getAllBooks() {
  try {
    // GET a list of book IDs of the current user
    var bookIDs = await superagent.get('/user/books');
    // wait for 3 seconds (just for the sake of this example)
    await delay();
    // GET information about each book
    return superagent.get('/books/ids='+JSON.stringify(bookIDs));
  } catch(error) {
    // If any of the awaited promises was rejected, this catch block
    // would catch the rejection reason
    return null;
  }
}

// Start an IIFE to use `await` at the top level
(async function(){
  let books = await getAllBooks();
  console.log(books);
})();
Current browser and node versions support async/await. You can also support older environments by transforming your code to ES5 with the help of regenerator (or tools that use regenerator, such as Babel).
Let functions accept callbacks
A callback is when function 1 is passed to function 2. Function 2 can call function 1 whenever it is ready. In the context of an asynchronous process, the callback will be called whenever the asynchronous process is done. Usually, the result is passed to the callback.
In the example of the question, you can make foo accept a callback and use it as success callback. So this
var result = foo();
// Code that depends on 'result'
becomes
foo(function(result) {
    // Code that depends on 'result'
});
Here we defined the function ""inline"" but you can pass any function reference:
function myCallback(result) {
    // Code that depends on 'result'
}

foo(myCallback);
foo itself is defined as follows:
function foo(callback) {
    $.ajax({
        // ...
        success: callback
    });
}
callback will refer to the function we pass to foo when we call it and we pass it on to success. I.e. once the Ajax request is successful, $.ajax will call callback and pass the response to the callback (which can be referred to with result, since this is how we defined the callback).
You can also process the response before passing it to the callback:
function foo(callback) {
    $.ajax({
        // ...
        success: function(response) {
            // For example, filter the response
            callback(filtered_response);
        }
    });
}
It's easier to write code using callbacks than it may seem. After all, JavaScript in the browser is heavily event-driven (DOM events). Receiving the Ajax response is nothing else but an event. Difficulties could arise when you have to work with third-party code, but most problems can be solved by just thinking through the application flow.
ES2015+: Promises with then()
The Promise API is a new feature of ECMAScript 6 (ES2015), but it has good browser support already. There are also many libraries which implement the standard Promises API and provide additional methods to ease the use and composition of asynchronous functions (e.g., bluebird).
Promises are containers for future values. When the promise receives the value (it is resolved) or when it is canceled (rejected), it notifies all of its ""listeners"" who want to access this value.
The advantage over plain callbacks is that they allow you to decouple your code and they are easier to compose.
Here is an example of using a promise:
function delay() {
  // `delay` returns a promise
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // Only `delay` is able to resolve or reject the promise
    setTimeout(function() {
      resolve(42); // After 3 seconds, resolve the promise with value 42
    }, 3000);
  });
}

delay()
  .then(function(v) { // `delay` returns a promise
    console.log(v); // Log the value once it is resolved
  })
  .catch(function(v) {
    // Or do something else if it is rejected
    // (it would not happen in this example, since `reject` is not called).
  });
.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }

Applied to our Ajax call we could use promises like this:
function ajax(url) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.onload = function() {
      resolve(this.responseText);
    };
    xhr.onerror = reject;
    xhr.open('GET', url);
    xhr.send();
  });
}

ajax(""https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1"")
  .then(function(result) {
    console.log(result); // Code depending on result
  })
  .catch(function() {
    // An error occurred
  });

Describing all the advantages that promise offer is beyond the scope of this answer, but if you write new code, you should seriously consider them. They provide a great abstraction and separation of your code.
More information about promises: HTML5 rocks - JavaScript Promises.
Side note: jQuery's deferred objects
Deferred objects are jQuery's custom implementation of promises (before the Promise API was standardized). They behave almost like promises but expose a slightly different API.
Every Ajax method of jQuery already returns a ""deferred object"" (actually a promise of a deferred object) which you can just return from your function:
function ajax() {
    return $.ajax(...);
}

ajax().done(function(result) {
    // Code depending on result
}).fail(function() {
    // An error occurred
});
Side note: Promise gotchas
Keep in mind that promises and deferred objects are just containers for a future value, they are not the value itself. For example, suppose you had the following:
function checkPassword() {
    return $.ajax({
        url: '/password',
        data: {
            username: $('#username').val(),
            password: $('#password').val()
        },
        type: 'POST',
        dataType: 'json'
    });
}

if (checkPassword()) {
    // Tell the user they're logged in
}
This code misunderstands the above asynchronous issues. Specifically, $.ajax() doesn't freeze the code while it checks the '/password' page on your server - it sends a request to the server and while it waits, it immediately returns a jQuery Ajax Deferred object, not the response from the server. That means the if statement is going to always get this Deferred object, treat it as true, and proceed as though the user is logged in. Not good.
But the fix is easy:
checkPassword()
.done(function(r) {
    if (r) {
        // Tell the user they're logged in
    } else {
        // Tell the user their password was bad
    }
})
.fail(function(x) {
    // Tell the user something bad happened
});
Not recommended: Synchronous ""Ajax"" calls
As I mentioned, some(!) asynchronous operations have synchronous counterparts. I don't advocate their use, but for completeness' sake, here is how you would perform a synchronous call:
Without jQuery
If you directly use a XMLHttpRequest object, pass false as third argument to .open.
jQuery
If you use jQuery, you can set the async option to false. Note that this option is deprecated since jQuery 1.8. You can then either still use a success callback or access the responseText property of the jqXHR object:
function foo() {
    var jqXHR = $.ajax({
        //...
        async: false
    });
    return jqXHR.responseText;
}
If you use any other jQuery Ajax method, such as $.get, $.getJSON, etc., you have to change it to $.ajax (since you can only pass configuration parameters to $.ajax).
Heads up! It is not possible to make a synchronous JSONP request. JSONP by its very nature is always asynchronous (one more reason to not even consider this option).",2022-04-08 13:02:30Z,6486
1758,14220321,Peter Mortensen,63550,"If you're not using jQuery in your code, this answer is for you
Your code should be something along the lines of this:
function foo() {
    var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
    httpRequest.open('GET', ""/echo/json"");
    httpRequest.send();
    return httpRequest.responseText;
}

var result = foo(); // Always ends up being 'undefined'
Felix Kling did a fine job writing an answer for people using jQuery for AJAX, but I've decided to provide an alternative for people who aren't.
(Note, for those using the new fetch API, Angular or promises I've added another answer below)
What you're facing
This is a short summary of ""Explanation of the problem"" from the other answer, if you're not sure after reading this, read that.
The A in AJAX stands for asynchronous. That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, .send returns immediately and the next statement, return result;, is executed before the function you passed as success callback was even called.
This means when you're returning, the listener you've defined did not execute yet, which means the value you're returning has not been defined.
Here is a simple analogy:
function getFive(){
    var a;
    setTimeout(function(){
         a=5;
    },10);
    return a;
}
(Fiddle)
The value of a returned is undefined since the a=5 part has not executed yet. AJAX acts like this, you're returning the value before the server got the chance to tell your browser what that value is.
One possible solution to this problem is to code re-actively , telling your program what to do when the calculation completed.
function onComplete(a){ // When the code completes, do this
    alert(a);
}

function getFive(whenDone){
    var a;
    setTimeout(function(){
         a=5;
         whenDone(a);
    },10);
}
This is called CPS. Basically, we're passing getFive an action to perform when it completes, we're telling our code how to react when an event completes (like our AJAX call, or in this case the timeout).
Usage would be:
getFive(onComplete);
Which should alert ""5"" to the screen. (Fiddle).
Possible solutions
There are basically two ways how to solve this:
Make the AJAX call synchronous (let’s call it SJAX).
Restructure your code to work properly with callbacks.
1. Synchronous AJAX - Don't do it!!
As for synchronous AJAX, don't do it! Felix's answer raises some compelling arguments about why it's a bad idea. To sum it up, it'll freeze the user's browser until the server returns the response and create a very bad user experience. Here is another short summary taken from MDN on why:
XMLHttpRequest supports both synchronous and asynchronous communications. In general, however, asynchronous requests should be preferred to synchronous requests for performance reasons.
In short, synchronous requests block the execution of code... ...this can cause serious issues...
If you have to do it, you can pass a flag. Here is how:
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', 'yourURL', false);  // `false` makes the request synchronous
request.send(null);

if (request.status === 200) {// That's HTTP for 'ok'
  console.log(request.responseText);
}
2. Restructure code
Let your function accept a callback. In the example code foo can be made to accept a callback. We'll be telling our code how to react when foo completes.
So:
var result = foo();
// Code that depends on `result` goes here
Becomes:
foo(function(result) {
    // Code that depends on `result`
});
Here we passed an anonymous function, but we could just as easily pass a reference to an existing function, making it look like:
function myHandler(result) {
    // Code that depends on `result`
}
foo(myHandler);
For more details on how this sort of callback design is done, check Felix's answer.
Now, let's define foo itself to act accordingly
function foo(callback) {
    var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
    httpRequest.onload = function(){ // When the request is loaded
       callback(httpRequest.responseText);// We're calling our method
    };
    httpRequest.open('GET', ""/echo/json"");
    httpRequest.send();
}
(fiddle)
We have now made our foo function accept an action to run when the AJAX completes successfully. We can extend this further by checking if the response status is not 200 and acting accordingly (create a fail handler and such). Effectively it is solving our issue.
If you're still having a hard time understanding this, read the AJAX getting started guide at MDN.",2021-04-09 11:45:40Z,1199
1759,14220321,Peter Mortensen,63550,"XMLHttpRequest 2 (first of all, read the answers from Benjamin Gruenbaum and Felix Kling)
If you don't use jQuery and want a nice short XMLHttpRequest 2 which works in the modern browsers and also in the mobile browsers, I suggest to use it this way:
function ajax(a, b, c){ // URL, callback, just a placeholder
  c = new XMLHttpRequest;
  c.open('GET', a);
  c.onload = b;
  c.send()
}
As you can see:
It's shorter than all other functions Listed.
The callback is set directly (so no extra unnecessary closures).
It uses the new onload (so you don't have to check for readystate && status)
There are some other situations, which I don't remember, that make the XMLHttpRequest 1 annoying.
There are two ways to get the response of this Ajax call (three using the XMLHttpRequest var name):
The simplest:
this.response
Or if for some reason you bind() the callback to a class:
e.target.response
Example:
function callback(e){
  console.log(this.response);
}
ajax('URL', callback);
Or (the above one is better anonymous functions are always a problem):
ajax('URL', function(e){console.log(this.response)});
Nothing easier.
Now some people will probably say that it's better to use onreadystatechange or the even the XMLHttpRequest variable name. That's wrong.
Check out XMLHttpRequest advanced features.
It supported all *modern browsers. And I can confirm as I have been using this approach since XMLHttpRequest 2 was created. I never had any type of problem in any browsers I used.
onreadystatechange is only useful if you want to get the headers on state 2.
Using the XMLHttpRequest variable name is another big error as you need to execute the callback inside the onload/oreadystatechange closures, or else you lost it.
Now if you want something more complex using POST and FormData you can easily extend this function:
function x(a, b, e, d, c){ // URL, callback, method, formdata or {key:val},placeholder
  c = new XMLHttpRequest;
  c.open(e||'get', a);
  c.onload = b;
  c.send(d||null)
}
Again ... it's a very short function, but it does GET and POST.
Examples of usage:
x(url, callback); // By default it's GET so no need to set
x(url, callback, 'post', {'key': 'val'}); // No need to set POST data
Or pass a full form element (document.getElementsByTagName('form')[0]):
var fd = new FormData(form);
x(url, callback, 'post', fd);
Or set some custom values:
var fd = new FormData();
fd.append('key', 'val')
x(url, callback, 'post', fd);
As you can see, I didn't implement sync... it's a bad thing.
Having said that ... why don't we do it the easy way?
As mentioned in the comment, the use of error && synchronous does completely break the point of the answer. Which is a nice short way to use Ajax in the proper way?
Error handler
function x(a, b, e, d, c){ // URL, callback, method, formdata or {key:val}, placeholder
  c = new XMLHttpRequest;
  c.open(e||'get', a);
  c.onload = b;
  c.onerror = error;
  c.send(d||null)
}

function error(e){
  console.log('--Error--', this.type);
  console.log('this: ', this);
  console.log('Event: ', e)
}
function displayAjax(e){
  console.log(e, this);
}
x('WRONGURL', displayAjax);
In the above script, you have an error handler which is statically defined, so it does not compromise the function. The error handler can be used for other functions too.
But to really get out an error, the only way is to write a wrong URL in which case every browser throws an error.
Error handlers are maybe useful if you set custom headers, set the responseType to blob array buffer, or whatever...
Even if you pass 'POSTAPAPAP' as the method it won't throw an error.
Even if you pass 'fdggdgilfdghfldj' as formdata it won't throw an error.
In the first case the error is inside the displayAjax() under this.statusText as Method not Allowed.
In the second case, it simply works. You have to check at the server side if you passed the right post data.
Cross-domain not allowed throws an error automatically.
In the error response, there aren't any error codes.
There is only the this.type which is set to error.
Why add an error handler if you totally don't have any control over errors? Most of the errors are returned inside this in the callback function displayAjax().
So: There isn't any need for error checks if you're able to copy and paste the URL properly. ;)
PS: As the first test I wrote x('x', displayAjax)..., and it totally got a response...??? So I checked the folder where the HTML is located, and there was a file called 'x.xml'. So even if you forget the extension of your file XMLHttpRequest 2 WILL FIND IT. I LOL'd
Read a file synchronous
Don't do that.
If you want to block the browser for a while load a nice big .txt file synchronous.
function omg(a, c){ // URL
  c = new XMLHttpRequest;
  c.open('GET', a, true);
  c.send();
  return c; // Or c.response
}
Now you can do
 var res = omg('thisIsGonnaBlockThePage.txt');
There is no other way to do this in a non-asynchronous way. (Yeah, with setTimeout loop... but seriously?)
Another point is... if you work with APIs or just your own list's files or whatever you always use different functions for each request...
Only if you have a page where you load always the same XML/JSON or whatever you need only one function. In that case, modify a little the Ajax function and replace b with your special function.
The functions above are for basic use.
If you want to extend the function...
Yes, you can.
I'm using a lot of APIs and one of the first functions I integrate into every HTML page is the first Ajax function in this answer, with GET only...
But you can do a lot of stuff with XMLHttpRequest 2:
I made a download manager (using ranges on both sides with resume, filereader, and filesystem), various image resizers converters using canvas, populate web SQL databases with base64images and much more...
But in these cases you should create a function only for that purpose... sometimes you need a blob, array buffers, you can set headers, override mimetype and there is a lot more...
But the question here is how to return an Ajax response... (I added an easy way.)",2021-04-09 11:57:18Z,444
1760,14220321,Peter Mortensen,63550,"If you're using promises, this answer is for you.
This means AngularJS, jQuery (with deferred), native XHR's replacement (fetch), Ember.js, Backbone.js's save or any Node.js library that returns promises.
Your code should be something along the lines of this:
function foo() {
    var data;
    // Or $.get(...).then, or request(...).then, or query(...).then
    fetch(""/echo/json"").then(function(response){
        data = response.json();
    });
    return data;
}

var result = foo(); // 'result' is always undefined no matter what.
Felix Kling did a fine job writing an answer for people using jQuery with callbacks for Ajax. I have an answer for native XHR. This answer is for generic usage of promises either on the frontend or backend.
The core issue
The JavaScript concurrency model in the browser and on the server with Node.js/io.js is asynchronous and reactive.
Whenever you call a method that returns a promise, the then handlers are always executed asynchronously - that is, after the code below them that is not in a .then handler.
This means when you're returning data the then handler you've defined did not execute yet. This in turn means that the value you're returning has not been set to the correct value in time.
Here is a simple analogy for the issue:
    function getFive(){
        var data;
        setTimeout(function(){ // Set a timer for one second in the future
           data = 5; // After a second, do this
        }, 1000);
        return data;
    }
    document.body.innerHTML = getFive(); // `undefined` here and not 5
Run code snippetExpand snippet
The value of data is undefined since the data = 5 part has not executed yet. It will likely execute in a second, but by that time it is irrelevant to the returned value.
Since the operation did not happen yet (Ajax, server call, I/O, and timer) you're returning the value before the request got the chance to tell your code what that value is.
One possible solution to this problem is to code re-actively, telling your program what to do when the calculation completed. Promises actively enable this by being temporal (time-sensitive) in nature.
Quick recap on promises
A Promise is a value over time. Promises have state. They start as pending with no value and can settle to:
fulfilled meaning that the computation completed successfully.
rejected meaning that the computation failed.
A promise can only change states once after which it will always stay at the same state forever. You can attach then handlers to promises to extract their value and handle errors. then handlers allow chaining of calls. Promises are created by using APIs that return them. For example, the more modern Ajax replacement fetch or jQuery's $.get return promises.
When we call .then on a promise and return something from it - we get a promise for the processed value. If we return another promise we'll get amazing things, but let's hold our horses.
With promises
Let's see how we can solve the above issue with promises. First, let's demonstrate our understanding of promise states from above by using the Promise constructor for creating a delay function:
function delay(ms){ // Takes amount of milliseconds
    // Returns a new promise
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
        setTimeout(function(){ // When the time is up,
            resolve(); // change the promise to the fulfilled state
        }, ms);
    });
}
Now, after we converted setTimeout to use promises, we can use then to make it count:
function delay(ms){ // Takes amount of milliseconds
  // Returns a new promise
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout(function(){ // When the time is up,
      resolve(); // change the promise to the fulfilled state
    }, ms);
  });
}

function getFive(){
  // We're RETURNING the promise. Remember, a promise is a wrapper over our value
  return delay(100).then(function(){ // When the promise is ready,
      return 5; // return the value 5. Promises are all about return values
  })
}
// We _have_ to wrap it like this in the call site, and we can't access the plain value
getFive().then(function(five){
   document.body.innerHTML = five;
});
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Basically, instead of returning a value which we can't do because of the concurrency model - we're returning a wrapper for a value that we can unwrap with then. It's like a box you can open with then.
Applying this
This stands the same for your original API call, you can:
function foo() {
    // RETURN the promise
    return fetch(""/echo/json"").then(function(response){
        return response.json(); // Process it inside the `then`
    });
}

foo().then(function(response){
    // Access the value inside the `then`
})
So this works just as well. We've learned we can't return values from already asynchronous calls, but we can use promises and chain them to perform processing. We now know how to return the response from an asynchronous call.
ES2015 (ES6)
ES6 introduces generators which are functions that can return in the middle and then resume the point they were at. This is typically useful for sequences, for example:
function* foo(){ // Notice the star. This is ES6, so new browsers, Nodes.js, and io.js only
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    while(true) yield 3;
}
Is a function that returns an iterator over the sequence 1,2,3,3,3,3,.... which can be iterated. While this is interesting on its own and opens room for a lot of possibility, there is one particular interesting case.
If the sequence we're producing is a sequence of actions rather than numbers - we can pause the function whenever an action is yielded and wait for it before we resume the function. So instead of a sequence of numbers, we need a sequence of future values - that is: promises.
This somewhat a tricky, but very powerful trick let’s us write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner. There are several ""runners"" that do this for you. Writing one is a short few lines of code, but it is beyond the scope of this answer. I'll be using Bluebird's Promise.coroutine here, but there are other wrappers like co or Q.async.
var foo = coroutine(function*(){
    var data = yield fetch(""/echo/json""); // Notice the yield
    // The code here only executes _after_ the request is done
    return data.json(); // 'data' is defined
});
This method returns a promise itself, which we can consume from other coroutines. For example:
var main = coroutine(function*(){
   var bar = yield foo(); // Wait our earlier coroutine. It returns a promise
   // The server call is done here, and the code below executes when done
   var baz = yield fetch(""/api/users/"" + bar.userid); // Depends on foo's result
   console.log(baz); // Runs after both requests are done
});
main();
ES2016 (ES7)
In ES7, this is further standardized. There are several proposals right now, but in all of them you can await promise. This is just ""sugar"" (nicer syntax) for the ES6 proposal above by adding the async and await keywords. Making the above example:
async function foo(){
    var data = await fetch(""/echo/json""); // Notice the await
    // code here only executes _after_ the request is done
    return data.json(); // 'data' is defined
}
It still returns a promise just the same :)",2021-04-09 13:10:23Z,362

Promises can be used to unnest asynchronous functions and allows one to chain multiple functions together.

  promiseB = promiseA.then(
    function onSuccess(result) {
      return result + 1;

1765,14220321,Henke,9213345,"Most of the answers here give useful suggestions for when you have a single async operation, but sometimes, this comes up when you need to do an asynchronous operation for each entry in an array or other list-like structure. The temptation is to do this:
// WRONG
var results = [];
theArray.forEach(function(entry) {
    doSomethingAsync(entry, function(result) {
        results.push(result);
    });
});
console.log(results); // E.g., using them, returning them, etc.
Example:
Show code snippet
The reason that doesn't work is that the callbacks from doSomethingAsync haven't run yet by the time you're trying to use the results.
So, if you have an array (or list of some kind) and want to do async operations for each entry, you have two options: Do the operations in parallel (overlapping), or in series (one after another in sequence).
Parallel
You can start all of them and keep track of how many callbacks you're expecting, and then use the results when you've gotten that many callbacks:
var results = [];
var expecting = theArray.length;
theArray.forEach(function(entry, index) {
    doSomethingAsync(entry, function(result) {
        results[index] = result;
        if (--expecting === 0) {
            // Done!
            console.log(""Results:"", results); // E.g., using the results
        }
    });
});
Example:
Show code snippet
(We could do away with expecting and just use results.length === theArray.length, but that leaves us open to the possibility that theArray is changed while the calls are outstanding...)
Notice how we use the index from forEach to save the result in results in the same position as the entry it relates to, even if the results arrive out of order (since async calls don't necessarily complete in the order in which they were started).
But what if you need to return those results from a function? As the other answers have pointed out, you can't; you have to have your function accept and call a callback (or return a Promise). Here's a callback version:
function doSomethingWith(theArray, callback) {
    var results = [];
    var expecting = theArray.length;
    theArray.forEach(function(entry, index) {
        doSomethingAsync(entry, function(result) {
            results[index] = result;
            if (--expecting === 0) {
                // Done!
                callback(results);
            }
        });
    });
}
doSomethingWith(theArray, function(results) {
    console.log(""Results:"", results);
});
Example:
Show code snippet
Or here's a version returning a Promise instead:
function doSomethingWith(theArray) {
    return new Promise(function(resolve) {
        var results = [];
        var expecting = theArray.length;
        theArray.forEach(function(entry, index) {
            doSomethingAsync(entry, function(result) {
                results[index] = result;
                if (--expecting === 0) {
                    // Done!
                    resolve(results);
                }
            });
        });
    });
}
doSomethingWith(theArray).then(function(results) {
    console.log(""Results:"", results);
});
Of course, if doSomethingAsync passed us errors, we'd use reject to reject the promise when we got an error.)
Example:
Show code snippet
(Or alternately, you could make a wrapper for doSomethingAsync that returns a promise, and then do the below...)
If doSomethingAsync gives you a Promise, you can use Promise.all:
function doSomethingWith(theArray) {
    return Promise.all(theArray.map(function(entry) {
        return doSomethingAsync(entry);
    }));
}
doSomethingWith(theArray).then(function(results) {
    console.log(""Results:"", results);
});
If you know that doSomethingAsync will ignore a second and third argument, you can just pass it directly to map (map calls its callback with three arguments, but most people only use the first most of the time):
function doSomethingWith(theArray) {
    return Promise.all(theArray.map(doSomethingAsync));
}
doSomethingWith(theArray).then(function(results) {
    console.log(""Results:"", results);
});
Example:
Show code snippet
Note that Promise.all resolves its promise with an array of the results of all of the promises you give it when they are all resolved, or rejects its promise when the first of the promises you give it rejects.
Series
Suppose you don't want the operations to be in parallel? If you want to run them one after another, you need to wait for each operation to complete before you start the next. Here's an example of a function that does that and calls a callback with the result:
function doSomethingWith(theArray, callback) {
    var results = [];
    doOne(0);
    function doOne(index) {
        if (index < theArray.length) {
            doSomethingAsync(theArray[index], function(result) {
                results.push(result);
                doOne(index + 1);
            });
        } else {
            // Done!
            callback(results);
        }
    }
}
doSomethingWith(theArray, function(results) {
    console.log(""Results:"", results);
});
(Since we're doing the work in series, we can just use results.push(result) since we know we won't get results out of order. In the above we could have used results[index] = result;, but in some of the following examples we don't have an index to use.)
Example:
Show code snippet
(Or, again, build a wrapper for doSomethingAsync that gives you a promise and do the below...)
If doSomethingAsync gives you a Promise, if you can use ES2017+ syntax (perhaps with a transpiler like Babel), you can use an async function with for-of and await:
async function doSomethingWith(theArray) {
    const results = [];
    for (const entry of theArray) {
        results.push(await doSomethingAsync(entry));
    }
    return results;
}
doSomethingWith(theArray).then(results => {
    console.log(""Results:"", results);
});
Example:
Show code snippet
If you can't use ES2017+ syntax (yet), you can use a variation on the ""Promise reduce"" pattern (this is more complex than the usual Promise reduce because we're not passing the result from one into the next, but instead gathering up their results in an array):
function doSomethingWith(theArray) {
    return theArray.reduce(function(p, entry) {
        return p.then(function(results) {
            return doSomethingAsync(entry).then(function(result) {
                results.push(result);
                return results;
            });
        });
    }, Promise.resolve([]));
}
doSomethingWith(theArray).then(function(results) {
    console.log(""Results:"", results);
});
Example:
Show code snippet
...which is less cumbersome with ES2015+ arrow functions:
function doSomethingWith(theArray) {
    return theArray.reduce((p, entry) => p.then(results => doSomethingAsync(entry).then(result => {
        results.push(result);
        return results;
    })), Promise.resolve([]));
}
doSomethingWith(theArray).then(results => {
    console.log(""Results:"", results);
});

So if you are using Angular, React, or any other frameworks which do two-way data binding or store concept, this issue is simply fixed for you, so in easy words, your result is undefined at the first stage, so you have got result = undefined before you receive the data, then as soon as you get the result, it will be updated and get assigned to the new value which response of your Ajax call...
But how you can do it in pure JavaScript or jQuery for example as you asked in this question?
You can use a callback, promise and recently observable to handle it for you. For example, in promises we have some function like success() or then() which will be executed when your data is ready for you. The same with callback or the subscribe function on an observable.
For example, in your case which you are using jQuery, you can do something like this:
$(document).ready(function(){
    function foo() {
        $.ajax({url: ""api/data"", success: function(data){
            fooDone(data); // After we have data, we pass it to fooDone

    function fooDone(data) {
        console.log(data); // fooDone has the data and console.log it

1768,14220321,Peter Mortensen,63550,"It's a very common issue we face while struggling with the 'mysteries' of JavaScript. Let me try demystifying this mystery today.
Let's start with a simple JavaScript function:
function foo(){
    // Do something
    return 'wohoo';
}

let bar = foo(); // 'bar' is 'wohoo' here
That's a simple synchronous function call (where each line of code is 'finished with its job' before the next one in sequence), and the result is same as expected.
Now let's add a bit of twist, by introducing a little delay in our function, so that all lines of code are not 'finished' in sequence. Thus, it will emulate the asynchronous behavior of the function:
function foo(){
    setTimeout( ()=> {
        return 'wohoo';
   }, 1000)
}

let bar = foo() // 'bar' is undefined here
So there you go; that delay just broke the functionality we expected! But what exactly happened? Well, it's actually pretty logical if you look at the code.
The function foo(), upon execution, returns nothing (thus returned value is undefined), but it does start a timer, which executes a function after 1 second to return 'wohoo'. But as you can see, the value that's assigned to bar is the immediately returned stuff from foo(), which is nothing, i.e., just undefined.
So, how do we tackle this issue?
Let's ask our function for a promise. Promise is really about what it means: it means that the function guarantees you to provide with any output it gets in future. So let's see it in action for our little problem above:
function foo(){
   return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { // I want foo() to PROMISE me something
    setTimeout ( function(){
      // Promise is RESOLVED, when the execution reaches this line of code
       resolve('wohoo') // After 1 second, RESOLVE the promise with value 'wohoo'
    }, 1000 )
  })
}

let bar;
foo().then( res => {
    bar = res;
    console.log(bar) // Will print 'wohoo'
});
Thus, the summary is - to tackle the asynchronous functions like Ajax-based calls, etc., you can use a promise to resolve the value (which you intend to return). Thus, in short you resolve value instead of returning, in asynchronous functions.
UPDATE (Promises with async/await)
Apart from using then/catch to work with promises, there exists one more approach. The idea is to recognize an asynchronous function and then wait for the promises to resolve, before moving to the next line of code. It's still just the promises under the hood, but with a different syntactical approach. To make things clearer, you can find a comparison below:
then/catch version:
function saveUsers(){
     getUsers()
      .then(users => {
         saveSomewhere(users);
      })
      .catch(err => {
          console.error(err);
       })
 }
async/await version:
  async function saveUsers(){
     try{
        let users = await getUsers()
        saveSomewhere(users);
     }
     catch(err){
        console.error(err);
     }
  }",2021-04-09 14:05:22Z,122
1769,14220321,Peter Mortensen,63550,"Another approach to return a value from an asynchronous function, is to pass in an object that will store the result from the asynchronous function.
Here is an example of the same:
var async = require(""async"");

// This wires up result back to the caller
var result = {};
var asyncTasks = [];
asyncTasks.push(function(_callback){
    // some asynchronous operation
    $.ajax({
        url: '...',
        success: function(response) {
            result.response = response;

    });
});

async.parallel(asyncTasks, function(){
    // result is available after performing asynchronous operation
    console.log(result)
    console.log('Done');
});
I am using the result object to store the value during the asynchronous operation. This allows the result be available even after the asynchronous job.
I use this approach a lot. I would be interested to know how well this approach works where wiring the result back through consecutive modules is involved.",2016-12-17 12:55:25Z,113

if (!name) {

async1(name, callback) {
  if (name)
    callback(name)
  else {
    doSomething(callback)

1771,14220321,loretoparisi,758836,"The following example I have written shows how to
Handle asynchronous HTTP calls;
Wait for response from each API call;
Use Promise pattern;
Use Promise.all pattern to join multiple HTTP calls;
This working example is self-contained. It will define a simple request object that uses the window XMLHttpRequest object to make calls. It will define a simple function to wait for a bunch of promises to be completed.
Context. The example is querying the Spotify Web API endpoint in order to search for playlist objects for a given set of query strings:
[
 ""search?type=playlist&q=%22doom%20metal%22"",
 ""search?type=playlist&q=Adele""
]
For each item, a new Promise will fire a block - ExecutionBlock, parse the result, schedule a new set of promises based on the result array, that is a list of Spotify user objects and execute the new HTTP call within the ExecutionProfileBlock asynchronously.
You can then see a nested Promise structure, that lets you spawn multiple and completely asynchronous nested HTTP calls, and join the results from each subset of calls through Promise.all.
NOTE Recent Spotify search APIs will require an access token to be specified in the request headers:
-H ""Authorization: Bearer {your access token}"" 
So, you to run the following example you need to put your access token in the request headers:

The browser can be divided into three parts:
Event Loop
Web API
Event Queue
The event loop runs for forever, i.e., kind of an infinite loop. The event queue is where all your functions are pushed on some event (example: click).
This is one by one carried out of queue and put into the event loop which executes this function and prepares itself for the next one after the first one is executed. This means execution of one function doesn't start until the function before it in the queue is executed in the event loop.
Now let us think we pushed two functions in a queue. One is for getting a data from the server and another utilises that data. We pushed the serverRequest() function in the queue first and then the utiliseData() function. The serverRequest function goes in the event loop and makes a call to server as we never know how much time it will take to get data from server, so this process is expected to take time and so we busy our event loop thus hanging our page.
That's where Web API come into the role. It takes this function from the event loop and deals with the server making the event loop free, so that we can execute the next function from the queue.
The next function in the queue is utiliseData() which goes in the loop, but because of no data available, it goes to waste and execution of the next function continues until the end of the queue. (This is called Async calling, i.e., we can do something else until we get data.)
Let us suppose our serverRequest() function had a return statement in code. When we get back data from the server Web API, it will push it in the queue at the end of queue.
As it gets pushed at the end of the queue, we cannot utilise its data as there isn't any function left in our queue to utilise this data. Thus it is not possible to return something from the async call.
Thus the solution to this is callback or promise.
An image from one of the answers here correctly explains callback use...*
We give our function (function utilising data returned from the server) to a function calling the server.
function doAjax(callbackFunc, method, url) {
    var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xmlHttpReq.open(method, url);
    xmlHttpReq.onreadystatechange = function() {

        if (xmlHttpReq.readyState == 4 && xmlHttpReq.status == 200) {
            callbackFunc(xmlHttpReq.responseText);
        }
    }
    xmlHttpReq.send(null);
}
In my code it is called as:
function loadMyJson(categoryValue){
    if(categoryValue === ""veg"")

gen.next(); // Start it
gen.next((...args) => gen.next([...args])); // Set its callback function
If you need to target browsers that don't support ES6 you can run the code through Babel or closure-compiler to generate ECMAScript 5.
The callback ...args are wrapped in an array and destructured when you read them so that the pattern can cope with callbacks that have multiple arguments. For example with node fs:
const [err, data] = yield fs.readFile(filePath, ""utf-8"", callback);",2018-07-31 10:35:51Z,45

user663031",34959258,"We find ourselves in a universe which appears to progress along a dimension we call ""time"". We don't really understand what time is, but we have developed abstractions and vocabulary that let us reason and talk about it: ""past"", ""present"", ""future"", ""before"", ""after"".
The computer systems we build--more and more--have time as an important dimension. Certain things are set up to happen in the future. Then other things need to happen after those first things eventually occur. This is the basic notion called ""asynchronicity"". In our increasingly networked world, the most common case of asynchronicity is waiting for some remote system to respond to some request.
Consider an example. You call the milkman and order some milk. When it comes, you want to put it in your coffee. You can't put the milk in your coffee right now, because it is not here yet. You have to wait for it to come before putting it in your coffee. In other words, the following won't work:
var milk = order_milk();
put_in_coffee(milk);
Because JavaScript has no way to know that it needs to wait for order_milk to finish before it executes put_in_coffee. In other words, it does not know that order_milk is asynchronous--is something that is not going to result in milk until some future time. JavaScript, and other declarative languages execute one statement after another without waiting.
The classic JavaScript approach to this problem, taking advantage of the fact that JavaScript supports functions as first-class objects which can be passed around, is to pass a function as a parameter to the asynchronous request, which it will then invoke when it has completed its task sometime in the future. That is the ""callback"" approach. It looks like this:
order_milk(put_in_coffee);
order_milk kicks off, orders the milk, then, when and only when it arrives, it invokes put_in_coffee.
The problem with this callback approach is that it pollutes the normal semantics of a function reporting its result with return; instead, functions must not reports their results by calling a callback given as a parameter. Also, this approach can rapidly become unwieldy when dealing with longer sequences of events. For example, let's say that I want to wait for the milk to be put in the coffee, and then and only then perform a third step, namely drinking the coffee. I end up needing to write something like this:
order_milk(function(milk) { put_in_coffee(milk, drink_coffee); }
where I am passing to put_in_coffee both the milk to put in it, and also the action (drink_coffee) to execute once the milk has been put in. Such code becomes hard to write, and read, and debug.
In this case, we could rewrite the code in the question as:
var answer;
$.ajax('/foo.json') . done(function(response) {
  callback(response.data);
});

function callback(data) {
  console.log(data);
}
Enter promises
This was the motivation for the notion of a ""promise"", which is a particular type of value which represents a future or asynchronous outcome of some sort. It can represent something that already happened, or that is going to happen in the future, or might never happen at all. Promises have a single method, named then, to which you pass an action to be executed when the outcome the promise represents has been realized.
In the case of our milk and coffee, we design order_milk to return a promise for the milk arriving, then specify put_in_coffee as a then action, as follows:
order_milk() . then(put_in_coffee)
One advantage of this is that we can string these together to create sequences of future occurrences (""chaining""):
order_milk() . then(put_in_coffee) . then(drink_coffee)
Let's apply promises to your particular problem. We will wrap our request logic inside a function, which returns a promise:
function get_data() {
  return $.ajax('/foo.json');
}
Actually, all we've done is added a return to the call to $.ajax. This works because jQuery's $.ajax already returns a kind of promise-like thing. (In practice, without getting into details, we would prefer to wrap this call so as for return a real promise, or use some alternative to $.ajax that does so.) Now, if we want to load the file and wait for it to finish and then do something, we can simply say
get_data() . then(do_something)
for instance,
get_data() .
  then(function(data) { console.log(data); });
When using promises, we end up passing lots of functions into then, so it's often helpful to use the more compact ES6-style arrow functions:
get_data() .
  then(data => console.log(data));
The async keyword
But there's still something vaguely dissatisfying about having to write code one way if synchronous and a quite different way if asynchronous. For synchronous, we write
a();
b();
but if a is asynchronous, with promises we have to write
a() . then(b);
Above, we said, ""JavaScript has no way to know that it needs to wait for the first call to finish before it executes the second"". Wouldn't it be nice if there was some way to tell JavaScript that? It turns out that there is--the await keyword, used inside a special type of function called an ""async"" function. This feature is part of the upcoming version of ECMAScript (ES), but it is already available in transpilers such as Babel given the right presets. This allows us to simply write
async function morning_routine() {
  var milk   = await order_milk();
  var coffee = await put_in_coffee(milk);
  await drink(coffee);
}
In your case, you would be able to write something like
async function foo() {
  data = await get_data();
  console.log(data);

1779,14220321,David R Tribble,170383,"Short answer: Your foo() method returns immediately, while the $ajax() call executes asynchronously after the function returns. The problem is then how or where to store the results retrieved by the async call once it returns.
Several solutions have been given in this thread. Perhaps the easiest way is to pass an object to the foo() method, and to store the results in a member of that object after the async call completes.
function foo(result) {
    $.ajax({

1781,14220321,Henke,9213345,"1. A first stumbling step
As for many others, my encounter with asynchronous calls was puzzling at first.
I don't remember the details, but I may have tried something like:
let result;

$.ajax({
  url: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1',
  success: function (response) {
    console.log('\nInside $.ajax:');
    console.log(response);
    result = response;
  }
});

console.log('Finally, the result: ' + result);
.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }
<script src=
""https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js""></script>
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Whoops! The output of the line console.log('Finally, the result: ' + result); which I thought would be printed last, is actually printed before the other output! – And it doesn't contain the result: it just prints undefined. 1 How come?
A helpful insight
I distinctly remember my first aha! moment on how to understand asynchronous calls.
It was this comment saying:
you actually don't want to get the data out of a callback;
you want to get your data-needing action into the callback! 2
This is obvious in the example above.
But is it still possible to write code after the asynchronous call that deals with the response once it has completed?
2. Plain JavaScript and a callback function
The answer is yes! – It is possible.
One alternative is the use of a callback function in a continuation-passing style: 3
const url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/2';

function asynchronousCall (callback) {
  const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  request.open('GET', url);
  request.send();
  request.onload = function () {
    if (request.readyState === request.DONE) {
      console.log('The request is done. Now calling back.');
      callback(request.responseText);
    }
  };
}

asynchronousCall(function (result) {
  console.log('This is the start of the callback function. Result:');
  console.log(result);
  console.log('The callback function finishes on this line. THE END!');
});

console.log('LAST in the code, but executed FIRST!');
.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Note how the function asynchronousCall is void. It returns nothing. Instead, by calling asynchronousCall with an anonymous callback function (asynchronousCall(function (result) {...), this function executes the desired actions on the result, but only after the request has completed – when the responseText is available.
Running the above snippet shows how I will probably not want to write any code after the asyncronous call (such as the line LAST in the code, but executed FIRST!).
Why? – Because such code will happen before the asyncronous call delivers any response data.
Doing so is bound to cause confusion when comparing the code with the output.
3. Promise with .then() – or async/await
The .then() construct was introduced in the ECMA-262 6th Edition in June 2015, and the async/await construct was introduced in the ECMA-262 8th Edition in June 2017.
The code below is still plain JavaScript, replacing the old-school XMLHttpRequest with Fetch. 4
fetch('http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(responseBody => {
    console.log('.then() - the response body:');
    console.log(JSON.stringify(responseBody) + '\n\n');
  });

async function receiveAndAwaitPromise () {
  const responseBody =
    (await fetch('http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random')).json();
  console.log('async/await:');
  console.log(JSON.stringify(await responseBody) + '\n\n');
}

receiveAndAwaitPromise();
.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }
Run code snippetExpand snippet
A word of warning is warranted if you decide to go with the async/await construct. Note in the above snippet how await is needed in two places. If forgotten in the first place, there will be no output. If forgotten in the second place, the only output will be the empty object, {} (or [object Object] or [object Promise]).
Forgetting the async prefix of the function is maybe the worst of all – the output will be ""SyntaxError: missing ) in parenthetical"" – no mentioning of the missing async keyword.
4. Promise.all – array of URLs 5
Suppose we need to request a whole bunch of URLs. I could send one request, wait till it responds, then send the next request, wait till it responds, and so on ...
Aargh! – That could take a loong time. Wouldn't it be better if I could send them all at once, and then wait no longer than it takes for the slowest response to arrive?
As a simplified example, I will use:
urls = ['https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/2',
        'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/3']
The JSONs of the two URLs:
{""userId"":1,""id"":2,""title"":""quis ut nam facilis et officia qui"",
 ""completed"":false}
{""userId"":1,""id"":3,""title"":""fugiat veniam minus"",""completed"":false}
The goal is to get an array of objects, where each object contains the title value from the corresponding URL.
To make it a little more interesting, I will assume that there is already an array of names that I want the array of URL results (the titles) to be merged with:
namesonly = ['two', 'three']
The desired output is a mashup combining namesonly and urls into an array of objects:
[{""name"":""two"",""loremipsum"":""quis ut nam facilis et officia qui""},
{""name"":""three"",""loremipsum"":""fugiat veniam minus""}]
where I have changed the name of title to loremipsum.
const namesonly = ['two','three'];

const urls = ['https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/2',
  'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/3'];

Promise.all(urls.map(url => fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(responseBody => responseBody.title)))
  .then(titles => {
    const names = namesonly.map(value => ({ name: value }));
    console.log('names: ' + JSON.stringify(names));
    const latins = titles.map(value => ({ loremipsum: value }));
    console.log('latins:\n' + JSON.stringify(latins));
    const result =
      names.map((item, i) => Object.assign({}, item, latins[i]));
    console.log('result:\n' + JSON.stringify(result));
  });
.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }

All the above examples are short and succinctly convey how asynchronous calls may be used on toyish APIs. Using small APIs works well to explain concepts and working code, but the examples might be a bit of dry runs.
The next section will show a more realistic example on how APIs may be combined to create a more interesting output.
5. How to visualize a mashup in Postman 6
The MusicBrainz API has information about artists and music bands.
An example – a request for the British rock band Coldplay is:
http://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/artist/cc197bad-dc9c-440d-a5b5-d52ba2e14234?&fmt=json&inc=url-rels+release-groups.
The JSON response contains – among other things – the 25 earliest album titles by the band. This information is in the release-groups array. The start of this array, including its first object is:
...
  ""release-groups"": [
    {
      ""id"": ""1dc4c347-a1db-32aa-b14f-bc9cc507b843"",
      ""secondary-type-ids"": [],
      ""first-release-date"": ""2000-07-10"",
      ""primary-type-id"": ""f529b476-6e62-324f-b0aa-1f3e33d313fc"",
      ""disambiguation"": """",
      ""secondary-types"": [],
      ""title"": ""Parachutes"",
      ""primary-type"": ""Album""
    },
...
This JSON snippet shows that the first album by Coldplay is Parachutes. It also gives an id, in this case 1dc4c347-a1db-32aa-b14f-bc9cc507b843, which is a unique identifier of the album.
This identifier can be used to make a lookup in the Cover Art Archive API:
http://coverartarchive.org/release-group/1dc4c347-a1db-32aa-b14f-bc9cc507b843. 7
For each album, the JSON response contains some images, one of which is the front cover of the album. The first few lines of the response to the above request:
{
  ""images"": [
    {
      ""approved"": true,
      ""back"": false,
      ""comment"": """",
      ""edit"": 22132705,
      ""front"": true,
      ""id"": 4086974851,
      ""image"": ""http://coverartarchive.org/release/435fc965-9121-461e-b8da-d9b505c9dc9b/4086974851.jpg"",
      ""thumbnails"": {
        ""250"": ""http://coverartarchive.org/release/435fc965-9121-461e-b8da-d9b505c9dc9b/4086974851-250.jpg"",
        ""500"": ""http://coverartarchive.org/release/435fc965-9121-461e-b8da-d9b505c9dc9b/4086974851-500.jpg"",
        ""1200"": ""http://coverartarchive.org/release/435fc965-9121-461e-b8da-d9b505c9dc9b/4086974851-1200.jpg"",
        ""large"": ""http://coverartarchive.org/release/435fc965-9121-461e-b8da-d9b505c9dc9b/4086974851-500.jpg"",
= = >   ""small"": ""http://coverartarchive.org/release/435fc965-9121-461e-b8da-d9b505c9dc9b/4086974851-250.jpg""
    },
...
Of interest here is the line ""small"": ""http://coverartarchive.org/release/435fc965-9121-461e-b8da-d9b505c9dc9b/4086974851-250.jpg"".
That URL is a direct link to the front cover of the Parachutes album.
The code to create and visualize the mashup
The overall task is to use Postman to visualize all the album titles and front covers of a music band. How to write code to achieve this has already been described in quite some detail in an answer to the question How can I visualize an API mashup in Postman? – Therefore I will avoid lengthy discussions here and just present the code and a screenshot of the result:
const lock = setTimeout(() => {}, 43210);
const albumsArray = [];
const urlsArray = [];
const urlOuter = 'https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/artist/' +
  pm.collectionVariables.get('MBID') + '?fmt=json&inc=url-rels+release-groups';
pm.sendRequest(urlOuter, (_, responseO) => {
  const bandName = responseO.json().name;
  const albums = responseO.json()['release-groups'];
  for (const item of albums) {
    albumsArray.push(item.title);
    urlsArray.push('https://coverartarchive.org/release-group/' + item.id);
  }
  albumsArray.length = urlsArray.length = 15;
  const images = [];
  let countDown = urlsArray.length;
  urlsArray.forEach((url, index) => {
    asynchronousCall(url, imageURL => {
      images[index] = imageURL;
      if (--countDown === 0) { // Callback for ALL starts on next line.
        clearTimeout(lock); // Unlock the timeout.
        const albumTitles = albumsArray.map(value => ({ title: value }));
        const albumImages = images.map(value => ({ image: value }));
        const albumsAndImages = albumTitles.map(
          (item, i) => Object.assign({}, item, albumImages[i]));
        const template = `<table>
          <tr><th>` + bandName + `</th></tr>
          {{#each responseI}}
          <tr><td>{{title}}<br><img src=""{{image}}""></td></tr>
          {{/each}}
        </table>`;
        pm.visualizer.set(template, { responseI: albumsAndImages });
      }
    });
  });
  function asynchronousCall (url, callback) {
    pm.sendRequest(url, (_, responseI) => {
      callback(responseI.json().images.find(obj => obj.front === true)
        .thumbnails.small); // Individual callback.
    });
  }
});

The result and documentation

How to download and run the Postman Collection
Running the Postman Collection should be straightforward.
Assuming you are using the desktop version of Postman, do as follows:
Download and save
http://henke.atwebpages.com/postman/mbid/MusicBands.pm_coll.json
in a suitable place on your hard drive.
In Postman, Ctrl + O > Upload Files > MusicBands.pm_coll.json > Import.
You should now see MusicBands among your collections in Postman.
Collections > MusicBands > DummyRequest > Send. 8
In the Postman Response Body, click Visualize.
You should now be able to scroll 15 albums as indicated by the screenshot above.

There is a problem with using promises!
Why should we use our own custom Promise?
I was using this solution for a while until I figured out there is an error in old browsers:
Uncaught ReferenceError: Promise is not defined
So I decided to implement my own Promise class for ES3 to below JavaScript compilers if it's not defined. Just add this code before your main code and then safely use Promise!
if(typeof Promise === ""undefined""){
    function _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) {
        if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) {
            throw new TypeError(""Cannot call a class as a function"");

    }

1784,14220321,Peter Mortensen,63550,"Of course there are many approaches like synchronous request, promise, but from my experience I think you should use the callback approach. It's natural to asynchronous behavior of JavaScript.
So, your code snippet can be rewritten to be a little different:
function foo() {
    var result;

    $.ajax({
        url: '...',
        success: function(response) {
            myCallback(response);

function myCallback(response) {

1785,14220321,Peter Mortensen,63550,"The question was:
How do I return the response from an asynchronous call?
which can be interpreted as:
How to make asynchronous code look synchronous?
The solution will be to avoid callbacks, and use a combination of Promises and async/await.
I would like to give an example for an Ajax request.
(Although it can be written in JavaScript, I prefer to write it in Python, and compile it to JavaScript using Transcrypt. It will be clear enough.)
Let’s first enable jQuery usage, to have $ available as S:
__pragma__ ('alias', 'S', '$')
Define a function which returns a Promise, in this case an Ajax call:
def read(url: str):
    deferred = S.Deferred()
    S.ajax({'type': ""POST"", 'url': url, 'data': { },
        'success': lambda d: deferred.resolve(d),
        'error': lambda e: deferred.reject(e)
    })
    return deferred.promise()
Use the asynchronous code as if it were synchronous:
async def readALot():
    try:
        result1 = await read(""url_1"")
        result2 = await read(""url_2"")
    except Exception:
        console.warn(""Reading a lot failed"")",2021-04-09 14:09:03Z,31
1786,14220321,Peter Mortensen,63550,"Rather than throwing code at you, there are two concepts that are key to understanding how JavaScript handles callbacks and asynchronicity (is that even a word?)
The Event Loop and Concurrency Model
There are three things you need to be aware of; The queue; the event loop and the stack
In broad, simplistic terms, the event loop is like the project manager, it is constantly listening for any functions that want to run and communicates between the queue and the stack.
while (queue.waitForMessage()) {
  queue.processNextMessage();
}
Once it receives a message to run something it adds it to the queue. The queue is the list of things that are waiting to execute (like your AJAX request). imagine it like this:
call foo.com/api/bar using foobarFunc
Go perform an infinite loop ... and so on
When one of these messages is going to execute it pops the message from the queue and creates a stack, the stack is everything JavaScript needs to execute to perform the instruction in the message. So in our example it's being told to call foobarFunc
function foobarFunc (var) {
  console.log(anotherFunction(var));
}
So anything that foobarFunc needs to execute (in our case anotherFunction) will get pushed onto the stack. executed, and then forgotten about - the event loop will then move onto the next thing in the queue (or listen for messages)
The key thing here is the order of execution. That is
WHEN is something going to run
When you make a call using AJAX to an external party or run any asynchronous code (a setTimeout for example), JavaScript is dependant upon a response before it can proceed.
The big question is when will it get the response? The answer is we don't know - so the event loop is waiting for that message to say ""hey run me"". If JavaScript just waited around for that message synchronously your app would freeze and it will suck. So JavaScript carries on executing the next item in the queue whilst waiting for the message to get added back to the queue.
That's why with asynchronous functionality we use things called callbacks. - A function or handler that, when passed into another function, will be executed at a later date. A promise uses callbacks (functions passed to .then() for example) as a way to reason about this asynchronous behaviour in a more linear way. The promise is a way of saying ""I promise to return something at some point"" and the callback is how we handle that value that is eventually returned. jQuery uses specific callbacks called deffered.done deffered.fail and deffered.always (amongst others). You can see them all here
So what you need to do is pass a function that is promised to execute at some point with data that is passed to it.
Because a callback is not executed immediately but at a later time it's important to pass the reference to the function not it executed. so
function foo(bla) {
  console.log(bla)
}
so most of the time (but not always) you'll pass foo not foo()
Hopefully that will make some sense. When you encounter things like this that seem confusing - i highly recommend reading the documentation fully to at least get an understanding of it. It will make you a much better developer.",2021-04-09 14:43:57Z,29

sum of lengths: count(n) = sum_from_0_to_n(3n)
formula: count(n) = (3n+1-1) / 2

Yet to make these words available for new programs with standard semantics, they also added a new standard header file <stdbool.h> with this specification:
7.18 Boolean type and values <stdbool.h>
1 The header <stdbool.h> defines four macros.
2 The macro
 bool
expands to _Bool.
3 The remaining three macros are suitable for use in #if preprocessing directives. They are
 true
which expands to the integer constant ((_Bool)+1u),
 false
which expands to the integer constant ((_Bool)+0u), and
 __bool_true_false_are_defined
which expands to the integer constant 1.
4 Notwithstanding the provisions of 7.1.3, a program may undefine and perhaps then redefine the macros bool, true, and false.
I you want to use boolean variables in your program, include the <stdbool.h> header file, declare them with the bool type and use true and false as constant values.
Note that the phrase macros are suitable for use in #if preprocessing directives is achieved using a trick: true is defined as ((_Bool)+1u), not ((_Bool)1u) so #if true expands to #if ((_Bool)+1u), which ultimately expands to #if ((0)+1u) hence defines a block of source code to be compiled, whereas #if ((0)1u) would have cause a preprocessor error.",2022-11-26 14:30:10Z,0

getLengthAndWidth(new int[][]{});
Compare that to:
getLengthAndWidth(null);
where arrs would be null.
So you need to check both cases, and do not proceed with the rest of the method when you find the array is null or empty.
public static void getLengthAndWidth(int[][] arrs){

    if(arrs == null || arrs.length == 0){
        System.out.println(""arrs is null or empty!"");

    System.out.println(""width: "" + arrs[0].length);
    System.out.println(""height: "" + arrs.length);
    
}
Now your method would not throw IndexOutOfBoundsException.
Note that this only checks if the outer array is null or empty, not the inner arrays, as you have asked. However, as you may or may not know, the inner arrays can be empty, or null, or have different lengths, i.e. I could pass in:
getLengthAndWidth(new int[][]{
    null, {}, { 1, 2, 3 }, { 1, 2 }
});
If you also want to validate the inner arrays, you should loop through each of them (e.g. with a stream or for loop), check if any of them is null and/or has a non-zero length and/or has a different length than the others.
For example, this checks that all the inner arrays are non null and non empty.
if(arrs == null || 
    arrs.length == 0 ||
    Arrays.stream(arrs).anyMatch(arr -> arr == null || arr.length == 0)){

1856,74582432,ChrisB,7204912,"The problem is that the nested function s has it's own variable scope. While it can read variables (like res) from the enclosing scope (maxProduct), any assignment (e.g. res = max(...)) will introduce a variable in the scope of s, instead of writing to the outer (res). Because in this case maxProduct wants to read the modified version of res that s produced, the trick of adding a member variable to self is used. (In that case, s only reads the reference to self, and then adds a member, avoiding the scope issue).
See this little example for demonstration:
def foo():
        def bar():
                x=2
        x=1
        bar()

1857,74582432,Masklinn,8182118,"Why res has to be initialized as self.res while total does not?
It does not, but because of the rules of Python's implicit declarations, by default assignment is declaration.
Since s only reads from total, it necessarily has to come from somewhere else, but because of
 res = max(self.res, left * (total - left), right * (total - right))
Python will create a res variable which is local to s, so you really have two different variables with the same name, one in maxProduct and one in s. This is called shadowing.
You can tell Python that a variable being assigned to is not a local by explicitly declaring it so:
nonlocal res
This will make Python assign to the lexically closest variable of that name:
def foo():
    a = 1
    def bar():
        a = 2
    bar()
    print(a)

Use "" %c"" with a leading blank to skip optional white space. Do not use a trailing blank in a scanf() format string.
Note that this still doesn't consume any trailing whitespace left in the input stream, not even to the end of a line, so beware of that if also using getchar() or fgets() on the same input stream. We're just getting scanf to skip over whitespace before conversions, like it does for %d and other non-character conversions.
Note that non-whitespace ""directives"" (to use POSIX scanf terminology) other than conversions, like the literal text in scanf(""order = %d"", &order); doesn't skip whitespace either. The literal order has to match the next character to be read.
So you probably want "" order = %d"" there if you want to skip a newline from the previous line but still require a literal match on a fixed string, like this question.",2020-01-12 15:56:37Z,118

scanf(""%d%*c"",&a); // line 1
scanf(""%c%*c"",&c1); // line 3
scanf will then read the next char (that is, the newline) but not assign it to any pointer.
In the end, however, I would second the FAQ's last option:
Or, depending on your requirements, you could also forget about scanf()/getchar(), use fgets() to get a line of text from the user and parse it yourself.",2019-01-27 23:17:20Z,10
1891,5240789,ilkkachu,6372809,"To echo what I have posted in another answer about C++: I suggest to toss scanf() away, to never use it, and to instead use fgets() and sscanf().
The reason for this is, that at least in Unix-like systems by default, the terminal your CLI program runs on does some processing of the user input before your program sees it. It buffers input until a newline is entered, and allows for some rudimentary line editing, like making backspace work.
So, you can never get a single character at a time, or a few single characters, just a full line. But that's not what e.g. scanf(""%d"") processes, instead it processes just the digits, and stops there, leaving the rest buffered in the C library, for a future stdio function to use. If your program has e.g.
printf(""Enter a number: "");
scanf(""%d"", &a);

printf(""Enter a word: "");
scanf(""%s"", word);
and you enter the line 123 abcd, it completes both scanf()s at once, but only after a newline is given. The first scanf() doesn't return when a user has hit space, even though that's where the number ends (because at that point the line is still in the terminal's line buffer); and the second scanf() doesn't wait for you to enter another line (because the input buffer already contains enough to fill the %s conversion).
This isn't what users usually expect!
Instead, they expect that hitting enter completes the input, and if you hit enter, you either get a default value, or an error, with possibly a suggestion to please really just give the answer.
You can't really do that with scanf(""%d""). If the user just hits enter, nothing happens. Because scanf() is still waiting for the number. The terminal sends the line onward, but your program doesn't see it, because scanf() eats it. You don't get a chance to react to the user's mistake.
That's also not very useful.
Hence, I suggest using fgets() or getline() to read a full line of input at a time. This exactly matches what the terminal gives, and always gives your program control after the user has entered a line. What you do with the input line is up to you, if you want a number, you can use atoi(), strtol(), or even sscanf(buf, ""%d"", &a) to parse the number. sscanf() doesn't have the same mismatch as scanf(), because the buffer it reads from is limited in size, and when it ends, it ends -- the function can't wait for more.
(fscanf() on a regular file can also be fine if the file format is one that supports how it skims over newlines like any whitespace. For line-oriented data, I'd still use fgets() and sscanf().)
So, instead of what I had above, use something like this:
printf(""Enter a number: "");

fgets(buf, bufsize, stdin);
sscanf(buf, ""%d"", &a);
or, actually, check the return value of sscanf() too, so you can detect empty lines and otherwise invalid data:
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    const int bufsize = 100;
    char buf[bufsize];
    int a;
    int ret;
    char word[bufsize];

    printf(""Enter a number: "");
    fgets(buf, bufsize, stdin);

    ret = sscanf(buf, ""%d"", &a);

    if (ret != 1) {
        fprintf(stderr, ""Ok, you don't have to.\n"");
        return 1;
    }

    printf(""Enter a word: "");
    fgets(buf, bufsize, stdin);

    ret = sscanf(buf, ""%s"", word);
    if (ret != 1) {
        fprintf(stderr, ""You make me sad.\n"");
        return 1;
    }

    printf(""You entered %d and %s\n"", a, word);
}
Of course, if you want the program to insist, you can create a simple function to loop over the fgets() and sscanf() until the user deigns to do what they're told; or to just exit with an error immediately. Depends on what you think your program should do if the user doesn't want to play ball.
You could do something similar e.g. by looping over getchar() to read characters until a newline after scanf(""%d"") returned, thus clearing up any garbage left in the buffer, but that doesn't do anything about the case where the user just hits enter on an empty line. Anyway, fgets() would read until a newline, so you don't have to do it yourself.",2021-09-23 14:13:32Z,10

By contrast, I would prefer to recommend the second way. Because it's more readable and maintainable. For example, in first way, you must think a while before adding/moving some scanf().",2022-09-08 13:47:18Z,0

The best way to think about this is a two pronged approach:
Can I find a path with 1 move? If not, try with 2 moves, 3 moves, etc. till you hit an upper bound and you decide to stop trying.
Instead of ""searching,"" imagine a path is given to you; how would you check that it's a good path? The magic of SMT solving is that if you can write a program that verifies a ""alleged"" solution is indeed good, it can find you one that is indeed good.

So, it found a solution with 5 moves; you can chase it in your grid to see that it's indeed correct. (The numbering starts at 0,0 at the top-left corner; increasing as you go to right and down.) Additionally, you’re guaranteed that this is a shortest solution (not necessarily unique of course). That is, there are no solutions with less than 5 moves.
I should add that there are other ways to solve this problem without iterating, by using z3 sequences. However that’s even more advanced z3 programming, and likely to be less performant as well. For all practical purposes, the iterative approach presented here is a good way to tackle such search problems in z3.

The basic building blocks in the model are pyomo expressions, so you could put in a little ""helper function"" to build expressions (the cost function shown, which is dependent on n) which are not defined within the model, but just pop out an expression...totally legal). You can also ""break up"" large expressions into smaller expressions (like the other_stuff below) and then just kludge them all together in the objective (or where needed) this gives you the opportunity to evaluate them independently. I've made several models with an objective function that has a ""cost"" component and a ""penalty"" component by dividing it into 2 expressions.... Then when solved, you can inspect them independently.
My suggestion (if you don't like the triple sum in your current model) is to make an avg_cost(n) function to build the expression similar to what is done in the nonsensical function below, and use that as a substitute for a new variable.
Note: the initialization of the variables here is generally unnecessary. I just did it to ""simulate solving"" or they would be None...
Code:
import pyomo.environ as pyo

m = pyo.ConcreteModel()

m.N = pyo.Set(initialize=[0,1,2])

m.x = pyo.Var(m.N, initialize = 2.0)

m.other_stuff = 3 * m.x[1] + 4 * m.x[2]

m.costs = sum(cost(n) for n in {0,1})

m.obj_expr = m.costs + m.other_stuff

m.obj = pyo.Objective(expr= m.obj_expr)


# inspect cost at a particular value of n...
print(cost(1))

    'a': np.array([0.6, 0.2, 0.2]),

Explanation
Given xs a list of initial states, we make a new list of states with the list comprehension: [np.random.choice(labels, p=Px[x]) for x in xs]. We then assign this back to xs (with the ""walrus operator""), and iterate k times.
Fun stuff
The more usual definition of a finite state Markov chain is with the transition matrix:
P = np.c_[list(Px.values())]
>>> P
array([[0.6, 0.2, 0.2],
       [0.2, 0.6, 0.2],
       [0.2, 0.2, 0.6]])
(And you can map the labels separately, or use pandas with labels as index and columns).
What is the expected state distribution after two transitions given an initial state (1,0,0) ('a')?
>>> np.array((1,0,0)) @ P @ P
array([0.44, 0.28, 0.28])
What is the terminal expected state distribution given an initial state (1,0,0)?
# approximation of v @ P^inf
>>> np.array((1,0,0)) @ np.linalg.matrix_power(P, int(10**9))
array([0.33333334, 0.33333334, 0.33333334])
More precisely: what is the stationary distribution (a state distribution such that it is unchanged by transition P)?
w, v = np.linalg.eig(P.T)  # left eigen system
k = np.argmax(w)
assert np.allclose(w[k], 1), 'no stationary state!'
e = v[:, k]
e /= e.sum()
>>> e
array([0.33333333, 0.33333333, 0.33333333])

>>> e @ P
array([0.33333333, 0.33333333, 0.33333333])

This produces one representation of a hypergraph with smooth shapes representing each collection. If a node is represented in many groups it may be hard to visualize this way.
Another way is to put the nodes on the left column and draw edges connecting each node in a group in each subsequent column. The representation is shown below:

A clear sign of over-fitting is when the training loss is very low, but the validation errors are large.
Why does this happen? Well, neural networks have so many degrees-of-freedom that in some cases, they ""memorize"" the training data on a point-by-point basis, but they do not build internal rules to classify the data in a physical manner.
The best way to overcome this is to reduce the size of the neural network, to avoid having too many redundant degrees-of-freedom that contribute to over-fitting, or to introduce regularization:
https://towardsdatascience.com/l1-and-l2-regularization-methods-ce25e7fc831c?gi=519207f1e90d
Also, if you have any hints about a numerical or physical framework that is well-suited for your problem (for example, a special transformation for your input data), you should also consider adding it to the neural network manually.

Here is part of the introduction about CSV writer objects (bold added):
A row must be an iterable of strings or numbers for Writer objects and a dictionary mapping fieldnames to strings or numbers... for DictWriter objects
But you are passing in a single string: ""Adam,12"". So what's going on?
Strings themselves are iterables over the characters in the string:
>>> for character in ""Adam"":
...     print(character)
...
A
d
a
m
And since Python doesn't have a distinct character class, each of those single-character values is also a string. So strings are iterables of strings.
When you give an iterable of strings to csvwriter.writerow(), it writes each string in the iterable to its own column. In this case, that means one-character strings taken from the input.
To get the behaviour you're after, you'll need to pass something like [""Adam"", 12] (not ""Adam,12"") to the CSV writer. I'm not sure where your inputs are coming from, so there might be a better way to do this, but you could split your strings on the comma as you pass them in:
for data in allData:
    writer.writerow(data.split("",""))
This works because ""Adam,12"".split("","") returns [""Adam"", ""12""]. Note that this won't work properly if your inputs have multiple commas.
Edit:
If allData is a list of dictionaries, as you show in the edited question, you might be better off with a DictWriter instead of a regular writer:
Create an object which operates like a regular writer but maps dictionaries onto output rows. The fieldnames parameter is a sequence of keys that identify the order in which values in the dictionary passed to the writerow() method are written to file f.
In other words, something like this:
with open(""foo.csv"", ""w"") as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, [""name"", ""code"", ""points"", ""age""])
    for data in [{""name"": ""Adam"", ""code"": 12, ""points"": 0, ""age"": 18}]:

2022,74582163,fum4,8319730,"Updating state is best seen like an asynchronous operation. You cannot set state in a function / effect and expect it to immediately be updated, on the spot. Well, it technically is, but you won't see the updates in your ""already-running"" function.
I am pretty sure that if you extract your log in the component root it will display the appropriate value after the login function finishes executing and the component properly sets the new state.
If you do need the value in the function you should directly use res.data.
A deeper dive:
Whenever your login function runs it forms a closure around your current values (including currentUser which is undefined at the moment).
When you update the currentUser in the login function you basically inform react that you need to update that value. It will handle this in the background, preparing the state for the next render, but your login function will keep running with whatever values it started with. Your ""new"" state values will not be available until you run the function again. This is because the already-running function ""closed over"" old values, so it can only reference those.
As a side note, if you use a ref for instance you would not have this problem. Why? Because refs do not participate in the react lifecycle. When you modify a ref it changes on the spot. You will have the updated value precisely on the next line. State does not work like that, it is coupled to the component lifecycle, so it will update on the next render.",2022-11-26 14:57:39Z,1

android:dataExtractionRules not found.
What this means is the data extraction rules is not in the file structure of the folder. You can confirm this by looking in the physical structure of the app in your computer.
This is beginning to be an issue I believe is with Android studio. I have the same problem when a project is built some of the code is not built into the file structure.
There is two options you can do. You can check to see if it's there by going into the physical file structure, if it's not rebuild the app and check again. If it's still not there you may have to add it manually.
Second option is to start over from the point you added the extraction and build it as soon as you add it.
The reason why it failed to link is because it's not in the physical structure so it cannot find what it's looking for.
This is also an issue with the icons and mipmap, and a few others. I have sent a bug report to Android Studio but nothing has came back other than we will look into it..
So if you have a resource linking fail, check into the physical file structure to see if it's there.",2022-11-26 13:17:18Z,0

.equals() tests for value equality (whether they contain the same data).
Objects.equals() checks for null before calling .equals() so you don't have to (available as of JDK7, also available in Guava).
Consequently, if you want to test whether two strings have the same value you will probably want to use Objects.equals().
// These two have the same value
new String(""test"").equals(""test"") // --> true 

// ... but they are not the same object
new String(""test"") == ""test"" // --> false 

// ... neither are these
new String(""test"") == new String(""test"") // --> false 

// ... but these are because literals are interned by 
// the compiler and thus refer to the same object
""test"" == ""test"" // --> true 

// ... string literals are concatenated by the compiler
// and the results are interned.
""test"" == ""te"" + ""st"" // --> true

// ... but you should really just call Objects.equals()
Objects.equals(""test"", new String(""test"")) // --> true
Objects.equals(null, ""test"") // --> false
Objects.equals(null, null) // --> true
You almost always want to use Objects.equals(). In the rare situation where you know you're dealing with interned strings, you can use ==.
From JLS 3.10.5. String Literals:
Moreover, a string literal always refers to the same instance of class String. This is because string literals - or, more generally, strings that are the values of constant expressions (§15.28) - are ""interned"" so as to share unique instances, using the method String.intern.
Similar examples can also be found in JLS 3.10.5-1.
Other Methods To Consider
String.equalsIgnoreCase() value equality that ignores case. Beware, however, that this method can have unexpected results in various locale-related cases, see this question.
String.contentEquals() compares the content of the String with the content of any CharSequence (available since Java 1.5). Saves you from having to turn your StringBuffer, etc into a String before doing the equality comparison, but leaves the null checking to you.",2022-11-12 11:15:45Z,5984
2049,513832,"8 revs, 8 users 60%",513935,"== tests object references, .equals() tests the string values.
Sometimes it looks as if == compares values, because Java does some behind-the-scenes stuff to make sure identical in-line strings are actually the same object.
For example:
String fooString1 = new String(""foo"");
String fooString2 = new String(""foo"");

// Evaluates to false
fooString1 == fooString2;

// Evaluates to true
fooString1.equals(fooString2);

// Evaluates to true, because Java uses the same object
""bar"" == ""bar"";
But beware of nulls!
== handles null strings fine, but calling .equals() from a null string will cause an exception:
String nullString1 = null;
String nullString2 = null;

// Evaluates to true
System.out.print(nullString1 == nullString2);

// Throws a NullPointerException
System.out.print(nullString1.equals(nullString2));
So if you know that fooString1 may be null, tell the reader that by writing
System.out.print(fooString1 != null && fooString1.equals(""bar""));
The following are shorter, but it’s less obvious that it checks for null:
System.out.print(""bar"".equals(fooString1));  // ""bar"" is never null
System.out.print(Objects.equals(fooString1, ""bar""));  // Java 7 required",2020-04-26 23:59:09Z,769

.equals() compares String values.
Sometimes == gives illusions of comparing String values, as in following cases:
String a=""Test"";
String b=""Test"";
if(a==b) ===> true
This is because when you create any String literal, the JVM first searches for that literal in the String pool, and if it finds a match, that same reference will be given to the new String. Because of this, we get:
(a==b) ===> true
                       String Pool
     b -----------------> ""test"" <-----------------a
However, == fails in the following case:
String a=""test"";
String b=new String(""test"");
if (a==b) ===> false
In this case for new String(""test"") the statement new String will be created on the heap, and that reference will be given to b, so b will be given a reference on the heap, not in String pool.
Now a is pointing to a String in the String pool while b is pointing to a String on the heap. Because of that we get:
if(a==b) ===> false.
                String Pool
     ""test"" <-------------------- a

                   Heap

String a=""Test"";

This has been done so that these string instances can be cached. A typical program contains a lot of string references and caching these instances can decrease the memory footprint and increase the performance of the program.
When using == operator for string comparison you are not comparing the contents of the string, but are actually comparing the memory address. If they are both equal it will return true and false otherwise. Whereas equals in string compares the string contents.
So the question is if all the strings are cached in the system, how come == returns false whereas equals return true? Well, this is possible. If you make a new string like String str = new String(""Testing"") you end up creating a new string in the cache even if the cache already contains a string having the same content. In short ""MyString"" == new String(""MyString"") will always return false.
Java also talks about the function intern() that can be used on a string to make it part of the cache so ""MyString"" == new String(""MyString"").intern() will return true.

equals is actually the method of the Object class, but it is Overridden into the String class and a new definition is given which compares the contents of object.

Obviously == is faster, but will (might) give false results in many cases if you just want to tell if 2 Strings hold the same text.
Definitely the use of the equals() method is recommended.
Don't worry about the performance. Some things to encourage using String.equals():
Implementation of String.equals() first checks for reference equality (using ==), and if the 2 strings are the same by reference, no further calculation is performed!
If the 2 string references are not the same, String.equals() will next check the lengths of the strings. This is also a fast operation because the String class stores the length of the string, no need to count the characters or code points. If the lengths differ, no further check is performed, we know they cannot be equal.
Only if we got this far will the contents of the 2 strings be actually compared, and this will be a short-hand comparison: not all the characters will be compared, if we find a mismatching character (at the same position in the 2 strings), no further characters will be checked.
When all is said and done, even if we have a guarantee that the strings are interns, using the equals() method is still not that overhead that one might think, definitely the recommended way. If you want an efficient reference check, then use enums where it is guaranteed by the language specification and implementation that the same enum value will be the same object (by reference).",2020-08-20 07:07:45Z,101

In this tutorial I'll demonstrate several different ways to correctly compare Java strings, starting with the approach I use most of the time. At the end of this Java String comparison tutorial I'll also discuss why the ""=="" operator doesn't work when comparing Java strings.
Option 1: Java String comparison with the equals method Most of the time (maybe 95% of the time) I compare strings with the equals method of the Java String class, like this:
if (string1.equals(string2))
This String equals method looks at the two Java strings, and if they contain the exact same string of characters, they are considered equal.
Taking a look at a quick String comparison example with the equals method, if the following test were run, the two strings would not be considered equal because the characters are not the exactly the same (the case of the characters is different):
String string1 = ""foo"";
String string2 = ""FOO"";

if (string1.equals(string2))
{
    // this line will not print because the
    // java string equals method returns false:
    System.out.println(""The two strings are the same."")
}
But, when the two strings contain the exact same string of characters, the equals method will return true, as in this example:
String string1 = ""foo"";
String string2 = ""foo"";

// test for equality with the java string equals method
if (string1.equals(string2))
{
    // this line WILL print
    System.out.println(""The two strings are the same."")
}
Option 2: String comparison with the equalsIgnoreCase method
In some string comparison tests you'll want to ignore whether the strings are uppercase or lowercase. When you want to test your strings for equality in this case-insensitive manner, use the equalsIgnoreCase method of the String class, like this:
String string1 = ""foo"";
String string2 = ""FOO"";

 // java string compare while ignoring case
 if (string1.equalsIgnoreCase(string2))
 {
     // this line WILL print
     System.out.println(""Ignoring case, the two strings are the same."")
 }
Option 3: Java String comparison with the compareTo method
There is also a third, less common way to compare Java strings, and that's with the String class compareTo method. If the two strings are exactly the same, the compareTo method will return a value of 0 (zero). Here's a quick example of what this String comparison approach looks like:
String string1 = ""foo bar"";
String string2 = ""foo bar"";

// java string compare example
if (string1.compareTo(string2) == 0)
{
    // this line WILL print
    System.out.println(""The two strings are the same."")
}
While I'm writing about this concept of equality in Java, it's important to note that the Java language includes an equals method in the base Java Object class. Whenever you're creating your own objects and you want to provide a means to see if two instances of your object are ""equal"", you should override (and implement) this equals method in your class (in the same way the Java language provides this equality/comparison behavior in the String equals method).

It is the subclass' job to override this method if a further defining definition is required. Without it (i.e. using ==) only memory addresses are checked between two objects for equality. String overrides this .equals() method and instead of using the memory address it returns the comparison of strings at the character level for equality.
A key note is that strings are stored in one lump pool so once a string is created it is forever stored in a program at the same address. Strings do not change, they are immutable. This is why it is a bad idea to use regular string concatenation if you have a serious of amount of string processing to do. Instead you would use the StringBuilder classes provided. Remember the pointers to this string can change and if you were interested to see if two pointers were the same == would be a fine way to go. Strings themselves do not.",2018-02-08 19:12:44Z,41

The Java String class actually overrides the default equals() implementation in the Object class – and it overrides the method so that it checks only the values of the strings, not their locations in memory. This means that if you call the equals() method to compare 2 String objects, then as long as the actual sequence of characters is equal, both objects are considered equal.
The == operator checks if the two strings are exactly the same object.

They can't do that if you omit critical build files, like Makefile.am. If they wanted to add a new file or something to the project, they need the Makefile.am to modify it. So it should be included in the dist tarball.
Saying that the file is not required in order to build the software as-is without modification, is not the same thing as saying that it can be omitted.
In this specific case, automake-generated makefiles contain rules to check whether someone modified the Makefile.am file and if so, the rules will re-run automake to ensure everything is up to date and correct so you don't have to remember to do it by hand. However this of course requires that the Makefile.am file be present so make can determine that it's up to date.",2022-11-26 14:03:43Z,2

DESCRIPTION:
The scanf() family of functions scans input according to format as described below. This format may contain conversion specifications; the results from such conversions, if any, are stored in the locations pointed to by the pointer arguments that follow format. Each pointer argument must be of a type that is appropriate for the value returned by the corresponding conversion specification.
RETURN VALUE:
On success, these functions return the number of input items successfully matched and assigned; this can be fewer than provided for, or even zero, in the event of an early matching failure.
As per this, you should check the return value of scanf.
if (scanf (""%d%, &temp) != 1)
{
    fprintf(stderr, ""Error: Invalid input.\n"");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
It will take care of characters, but if you enter a floating point variable, it will truncate the number — discard the mantissa — and accept the whole part as a valid number. If you enter an integer followed by some junk, scanf reads the input till it find the first non-integer — leaving the rest of the input in the input buffer(which itself lead to 10 other problems) — and accepts the number. There are many other issues with scanf, you'll find plenty of questions pertaining to them on stackoverflow.
OT:
Suggest using the double data type. Suggest looking into fgets and strtol/strtod family of functions. Suggest reading the man page of the functions during coding.

2126,74582018,Quimby,7691729,"Oh the joys of overloading resolution rules and SFINAE.
The methods are equivalent to free functions:
void bbaz(Foo&,std::vector<int>::reverse_iterator){}
void bbaz(const Foo&,std::vector<int>::const_reverse_iterator){}
and your usage becomes:
int main()
{
    std::vector<int> v;
    Foo foo;
    bbaz(foo,v.crbegin());
}
The arguments do not exactly match either call:
foo is Foo&, not const Foo&
v.crbegin() return vector::const_reverse_iterator which is just a different instantiation of the same std::reverse_iterator template as vector::reverse_iterator.
reverse_iterator->std::reverse_iterator<vector::iterator>
const_reverse_iterator-> std::reverse_iterator<vector::const_iterator>
Cause of ambiguity
Now, the issue is that std::reverse_iterator's ctor is not SFINAE-friendly until C++20:
template< class U >
std::reverse_iterator( const std::reverse_iterator<U>& other );
I.e. there is a viable candidate converting std::reverse_iterator<T> to std::reverse_iterator<U> between any T-U pairs. In this case for T=vector::const_iterator, U=vector::iterator. But of course the template instantiation fails later because it cannot convert const int* to int*.
Since that happens in the template function's body, not the signature, it is too late for SFINAE and overloading considers it a viable candidate function, hence the ambiguity since both calls require one implicit conversion - although only the second one would compile.
This is explained in these answers, making this one essentially a duplicate of that question but it would be IMHO cruel to mark it as such without an explanation which I cannot fit into a comment.
C++20 fixes this omission and SFINAEs that ctor - cppreference:
This overload participates in overload resolution only if U is not the same type as Iter and std::convertible_to<const U&, Iter> is modeled (since C++20)
Solution
As pointed in the comments by @Eljay, forcing const Foo& at the call site is one option, one can use C++17 std::as_const:
#include <utility>
std::as_const(foo).baz(v.crbegin());
Fixing this at definition is more tricky, you could use SFINAE to actually force these overloads but that might be a hassle. @fabian 's solution with adding a third overload without const method qualifier seems easiest to me:
void Foo::baz(std::vector<int>::const_reverse_iterator x) { 
    return std::as_const(*this).baz(x); 
}
It works because now it is a better (exact) match for non-const Foos than the still considered vector::reverse_iterator which would not compile anyway.",2022-11-26 22:43:01Z,7

Why does that happen?
Because the func(args[i]) call gets inlined as long as it always calls the same function. Inlining avoids the call overhead, which is quite measurable for tiny functions.
Of course, real code would have exactly one sqrt function, so inlining those calls is absolutely the right strategy for engines. It only becomes a ""problem"" in the artificial scenario that's typically created by simple benchmarking frameworks.
This is one of the most commonly encountered pitfalls of microbenchmarking.
How can I make it consistent for 1st function also? I was thinking about adding dummy to skip the first execution
Yes, that's the obvious solution. It's what we do in some of our own microbenchmarks (example). Keep in mind that this intentionally disables a particular optimization; whether results generated this way are meaningful at all depends on what you're interested in.
(Note: for the record, microbenchmarking pitfalls apply to our own tests just as much as to everyone else's. Care must be taken when drawing conclusions from the results. We always check generated machine code to make sure those microbenchmarks measure what we want them to measure! And they're not our primary tools for making decisions, they're just one of several techniques we employ to keep an eye on performance and catch unexpected regressions.)
As an alternative, you could copy the getDuration function (and maybe measureTime as well) for each function that you want to measure. That may feel even less elegant, but it's actually closer to what real-world code would do, because it doesn't need to circumvent engine heuristics.
The best solution would be to not rely on microbenchmarks at all. Instead, take a real application that performs lots of sqrt operations, measure its performance with Math.sqrt, then plug in your custom replacement and measure performance again. That way, you'd see the actual impact in practice, and there wouldn't be a risk of microbenchmarking-specific artifacts polluting your results (and possibly leading you to the wrong conclusion about which of two options is faster).
This works only if the dummy repetition count is 32 or higher
Another heuristic. V8 only starts collecting type/call feedback for code that has been running for a while. This improves performance and reduces memory consumption for functions that don't run much. Needless to say, I wouldn't rely on the threshold always being 32, it may change with versions and circumstances.",2022-11-27 14:51:37Z,3

You use n as an index as well as the value. From the for loop it can be seen that n is the value of each element in the list MyArray. But later on you use this as an index when you call MyArrayNew[n]. When n is -1 there is propably some things that happen that you do not want.
lists indices can only be changed if they already exist. MyArrayNew starts of empty, so you can't say: change the third index to three, because the third index doesn't exist yet.
There are many approaches to solve this problem. I'll give one:
To solve the second problem I suggest appending instead of assigning indices. To solve the first problem, you could use for i in range len(arr):, but I prefer enumerate.

The second way is to use nested FOR ... LOOP and compare values in the array from Index 0 to the final item. I normally use a temp value to keep the previous value, compare it with the current, and swap the values according to the size. The example code below

You appear to have at least two different things attempting to set Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * and one of them is merging its attempt with the existing one to create a list of the existing value (*) and its own value (also *).
The attempt to set it with Spring should be running first so I doubt that is the cause of the problem. The documentation for traefik says Custom headers will overwrite existing headers if they have identical names so it shouldn't be that either.
You might be trying to set it in a third place. Perhaps in one of your nginx configuration files.
You need to search through your code base (including Docker configs and base images) and fix the duplicate attempts to set Access-Control-Allow-Origin (either by ensuring they are set to overwrite or by removing them).",2022-11-26 11:59:42Z,1

const newCityRef = db.collection('cities').doc(); // 👈 Generates a reference, but doesn't write yet

// Later...
const res = await newCityRef.set({
  newCityRef.id, // 👈 Writes the document ID

  const spaceID = spaceDoc.id

As a direct answer, the solution provided by several, including @Esko, using the Arrays.toString and Arrays.deepToString methods, is simply the best.
Java 8 - Stream.collect(joining()), Stream.forEach
Below I try to list some of the other methods suggested, attempting to improve a little, with the most notable addition being the use of the Stream.collect operator, using a joining Collector, to mimic what the String.join is doing.
int[] ints = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
System.out.println(IntStream.of(ints).mapToObj(Integer::toString).collect(Collectors.joining("", "")));
System.out.println(IntStream.of(ints).boxed().map(Object::toString).collect(Collectors.joining("", "")));
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(ints));

String[] strs = new String[] {""John"", ""Mary"", ""Bob""};
System.out.println(Stream.of(strs).collect(Collectors.joining("", "")));
System.out.println(String.join("", "", strs));
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(strs));

DayOfWeek [] days = { FRIDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY };
System.out.println(Stream.of(days).map(Object::toString).collect(Collectors.joining("", "")));
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(days));

// These options are not the same as each item is printed on a new line:

We could have used Arrays.toString(array) to print one dimensional array and Arrays.deepToString(array) for multi-dimensional arrays.
Java 8
Now we have got the option of Stream and lambda to print the array.
Printing One dimensional Array:
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] intArray = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    String[] strArray = new String[] {""John"", ""Mary"", ""Bob""};

    //Prior to Java 8
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(intArray));
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(strArray));

    // In Java 8 we have lambda expressions
    Arrays.stream(intArray).forEach(System.out::println);
    Arrays.stream(strArray).forEach(System.out::println);
}
The output is:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[John, Mary, Bob]
1
2
3
4
5
John
Mary
Bob
Printing Multi-dimensional Array Just in case we want to print multi-dimensional array we can use Arrays.deepToString(array) as:
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[][] int2DArray = new int[][] { {11, 12}, { 21, 22}, {31, 32, 33} };
    String[][] str2DArray = new String[][]{ {""John"", ""Bravo""} , {""Mary"", ""Lee""}, {""Bob"", ""Johnson""} };

    //Prior to Java 8
    System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(int2DArray));
    System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(str2DArray));

    // In Java 8 we have lambda expressions
    Arrays.stream(int2DArray).flatMapToInt(x -> Arrays.stream(x)).forEach(System.out::println);
    Arrays.stream(str2DArray).flatMap(x -> Arrays.stream(x)).forEach(System.out::println);
} 
Now the point to observe is that the method Arrays.stream(T[]), which in case of int[] returns us Stream<int[]> and then method flatMapToInt() maps each element of stream with the contents of a mapped stream produced by applying the provided mapping function to each element.
The output is:
[[11, 12], [21, 22], [31, 32, 33]]
[[John, Bravo], [Mary, Lee], [Bob, Johnson]]

Update :
Yes ! this is to be mention that converting an array to an object array OR to use the Object's array is costly and may slow the execution. it happens by the nature of java called autoboxing.

Please note, this is not a permanent fix by any means. Just a hack that can make debugging simpler.
Printing an array directly gives the internal representation and the hashCode. Now, all classes have Object as the parent-type. So, why not hack the Object.toString()? Without modification, the Object class looks like this:
public String toString() {
    return getClass().getName() + ""@"" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode());
}
What if this is changed to:
public String toString() {
    if (this instanceof boolean[])
        return Arrays.toString((boolean[]) this);
    if (this instanceof byte[])
        return Arrays.toString((byte[]) this);
    if (this instanceof short[])
        return Arrays.toString((short[]) this);
    if (this instanceof char[])
        return Arrays.toString((char[]) this);
    if (this instanceof int[])
        return Arrays.toString((int[]) this);
    if (this instanceof long[])
        return Arrays.toString((long[]) this);
    if (this instanceof float[])
        return Arrays.toString((float[]) this);
    if (this instanceof double[])
        return Arrays.toString((double[]) this);
    if (this instanceof Object[])
        return Arrays.deepToString((Object[]) this);
    return getClass().getName() + ""@"" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode());
}
This modded class may simply be added to the class path by adding the following to the command line: -Xbootclasspath/p:target/classes.
Now, with the availability of deepToString(..) since Java 5, the toString(..) can easily be changed to deepToString(..) to add support for arrays that contain other arrays.
I found this to be a quite useful hack and it would be great if Java could simply add this.

In this case it says HTMLCollection which is like a fancy array. This means when you look for nav, although there is only one element with that tag, it gets returned in an array. So you have something like this: [theNavElementYouWant].
To retrieve that element you should index the array to get the first entry, which is at index zero, like so:
var nav = document.getElementsByTagName(""nav"")[0]
Secondly, your navbar's height is set to 100px by your css code. So if you want to fully hide it, you should set its top position to -100px instead of -50px.
And third, since your navbar's position is fixed, then the container below it (div element with class=""container"") should have position: absolute; and top: 100px; such that it displays fully under the navbar. In order to see any behaviour at all though, the container's height should be bigger than the visible area on the screen, hence for testing purposes you can add height: 2000px; as well. Since you want your navbar to show as soon as you scroll up, then you might want to set the z-index of the navbar to be higher than the z-index of the container.
In that case you might want to change the container's position as well through your javascript.
js:
/* When the user scrolls down, hide the navbar. When the user scrolls up, show the navbar */ var prevScrollpos = window.pageYOffset;
window.onscroll = function() {
    var currentScrollPos = window.pageYOffset;
    var navigation = document.getElementsByTagName(""nav"")[0]
    var container = document.getElementsByClassName(""container"")[0]

    if (prevScrollpos > currentScrollPos) {
        navigation.style.top = ""0px"";
        container.style.top = ""100px""
    } else {
        navigation.style.top = ""-100px"";
        container.style.top = ""0px""
    }
    
    prevScrollpos = currentScrollPos;
}
css:
nav {
    background-color: violet;
    height: 100px;
    font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;
    color: #FFFCF2;
    position: fixed;
    border-bottom: 0;
    width: 100%;
    z-index: 5;

    background-color: blueviolet;
}

.container {
    position: absolute;
    top: 100px;
    height: 2000px;
    z-index: 0;

    background-color: yellow;
}
In many cases of beginners mistakes can happen in the folder structure as well. So make sure that you have the folder structure that matches your html imports. By that I mean the paths you use to link the corresponding css and javascript to your webpage. Since you have
<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""../css/styles.css"">

<script type = ""text/javascript"" src=""js/main.js""></script>
The folder structure should be:
project/
...css/
......styles.css
...src/
......index.html
......js/
.........main.js

2276,74581821,fum4,8319730,"As @ksav mentioned you are overwriting your theme in the second useEffect.
Simplifying the flow a bit, a specific fix for your code would be:
const ThemeProvider = ({ children }: ThemeProviderInterface) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<ThemeOpt>(localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light'); // directly initialising with local storage or default value

  useEffect(() => {
    if (theme) {
      localStorage.setItem('theme', theme)
    }
  }, [theme]); // every time the theme state updates we also update in local storage

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
@arp said something interesting though. You can and should update your data in the onClick handler as an effect is not necessary here. An effect will cause the local storage to be updated only after the state is set and the component re-renders, which is not needed. More than that, if you changed another state instead of modifying local storage then this would also cause an extra render (see automatic batching, which would not work with your code as updates are decoupled).
The conclusion is that you don't have to wait for the state to be updated in order to know that you should also update the local storage. You can do both of them at the same time in the onClick handler. This increases performance and is the recommended approach.",2022-11-26 14:26:00Z,0

2287,74581796,andrewJames,12567365,"From the error message we can see that you have defined nested as a variable of type BooleanQuery.
As the error messages say, the class BooleanQuery does not have a method add(Query, Occur). This means the following line will not compile:
nested.add(query1, BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD);
Instead, the code should be using a BooleanClause here, instead of a BooleanQuery.
One BooleanQuery is made up of one or more clauses, using BooleanClause.
So, you can do the following:
BooleanQuery.Builder bqBuilder = new BooleanQuery.Builder();

Query query1 = new TermQuery(new Term(""titulo"", ""cobra kai""));
Query query2 = new TermQuery(new Term(""titulo"", ""cobra""));
Query query3 = new TermQuery(new Term(""titulo"", ""kai""));

BooleanClause nested1 = new BooleanClause(query1, BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD);
BooleanClause nested2 = new BooleanClause(query2, BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD);
BooleanClause nested3 = new BooleanClause(query3, BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD);

bqBuilder.add(nested1);
bqBuilder.add(nested2);
bqBuilder.add(nested3);

BooleanQuery bq = bqBuilder.build();
That builds a boolean query containing 3 clauses:
Find titles containing ""cobra kai"" OR ""cobra"" OR ""kai"".
I am not sure what this is for:
bqbuilder.add(nested, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);
The BooleanClause.Occur.MUST does not appear to be needed, so I have dropped it from my code.
You can simplify the above code by using a loop.
Assuming you already have a list containing your search terms (your busqueda_separada list):
List<String> terms = Arrays.asList(""cobra kai"", ""cobra"", ""kai"");
You can use that list as follows:
for (String term : terms) {
    Query query = new TermQuery(new Term(""titulo"", term));
    BooleanClause nested = new BooleanClause(query, BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD);
    bqBuilder.add(nested);
}
BooleanQuery bq2 = bqBuilder.build();
Update
One point I forgot to mention:
In your data, you have a search phrase: cobra kai. It's possible that you do not need to search for this, depending on how your data was indexed, and how you expect your search to work.
But assuming you do need it, you need to wrap the phrase in double-quotes, so that it is treated as a single search phrase by Lucene:
List<String> terms = Arrays.asList(""\""cobra kai\"""", ""cobra"", ""kai"");
This ensures the generated search is:
titulo:""cobra kai"" titulo:cobra titulo:kai
And, by default, there is an implied ""OR"" in between each clause in the search.
Your ""extra"" question:
query should be like (titulo=“cobra kai” OR titulo=“cobra” OR titulo=“kai”) AND anio=“2018”
This is really a completely new question and you can see approaches in existing answers such as:
How to create nested boolean query with lucene API (a AND (b OR c))?
Lucene 6.0! How to instantiate a BooleanQuery and add other search queries in it?
and probably several more...
But one more approach (if I have understood correctly) is to nest 2 queries inside another boolean query and use Occur.MUST in that outer query for each clause.
So, you already have your first boolean query.
Now create another one. Actually if you only have one term, you don't even need a boolean query - just a term query:
Query query2 = new TermQuery(new Term(""year"", ""2018""));
Now place these two queries into a brand new boolean query (this new query contains the first two queries):
BooleanQuery.Builder bqBuilder = new BooleanQuery.Builder();
bqBuilder.add(bq1, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);
bqBuilder.add(query2, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);
BooleanQuery bq = bqBuilder.build();
The above is equivalent to the following Lucene classic query:
+(body:""cobra kai"" body:cobra body:kai) +year:2018
And that, in turn, is equivalent to:
(body:""cobra kai"" OR body:cobra OR body:kai) AND year:2018
Note that this uses the plus operator.
So the results MUST contain matches for both clauses - the clause for my body field and the clause for my year field.
This can all get quite confusing if you think about Lucene boolean operators in the same way that you think about Boolean algebra. But they are not the same and serve different purposes. Lucene is not (only) about including and excluding records, but about scoring those records for relevance.",2022-11-26 19:45:56Z,0

import cv2
cv2.imwrite('DEBUG-class4.png', c4)
That will give you a solid black image that just has pixels of class=4 in white and save it in a debug image with OpenCV. You can then use OpenCV again to find that contour and to find its centroid:
cnts, _ = cv2.findContours(c4, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

M = cv2.moments(cnts[0])

You are creating a new local Timer object which is not the aTimer static member of your class. OnTimedEvent does get called, but it in this line: aTimer.Stop() it is attempting to use the aTimer static member which is null due to missing initialization (and therefore throws an exception).
To fix it, change the line above to:
aTimer = new System.Timers.Timer();
This will initialize the static member of your class as I believe you intended, and will enable the handler to stop the timer.
Note that System.Timers.Timer is not thread-safe. The Elapsed handler is called on a separate thread (see: documentation), and therefore you need to synchronize calline Stop() with a lock, or even better: use System.Threading.Timer instead.",2022-11-26 12:39:52Z,3
2364,74581664,Theodor Zoulias,11178549,"This line throws a NullReferenceException:
aTimer.Stop();
The reason is that the static field aTimer is not initialized. You might think that you initialized it in the Main method, by you didn't. You assigned the new System.Timers.Timer() to a local variable, instead of the static field. Here are some suggestions and remarks:
Name your fields with an underscore _ as prefix. For example _timer. This is a widely adopted practice, and helps immensely at differentiating between fields and local variables.
In this case you don't need a static field. You can get a reference to the timer by casting the object source argument: var timer = (System.Timers.Timer)source;.
Be aware that any exception thrown by the Elapsed event handler is suppressed. Essentially there is a giant and invisible try { /*...*/ } catch { } around your code, that prevents the exception form surfacing. According to the docs, ""this behavior is subject to change in future releases of .NET Framework"". The chances of this behavior ever changing are zero. Despite what Microsoft says, they never do breaking changes like this.
The System.Timers.Timer is not thread-safe. Also it is not impossible for the Elapsed event to be invoked in overlapping manner. So calling the Stop method inside the event handler, results in undefined behavior (by the docs). If you want to play by the book, you should synchronize the Stop call (and all other interactions with the timer) with a lock.
My suggestion is to not use the System.Timers.Timer class. IMHO it's not a well designed component. Use a System.Threading.Timer instead. Just make sure that your System.Threading.Timers are rooted (you store a reference to them somewhere), because otherwise they are eligible for garbage collection (unlike the System.Timers.Timer which is rooted by itself).",2022-11-26 12:36:24Z,1

2385,12573816,n. m.,775806,"Compiling a C++ program takes place in several steps, as specified by 2.2 (credits to Keith Thompson for the reference):
The precedence among the syntax rules of translation is specified by the following phases [see footnote].
Physical source file characters are mapped, in an implementation-defined manner, to the basic source character set (introducing new-line characters for end-of-line indicators) if necessary. [SNIP]
Each instance of a backslash character (\) immediately followed by a new-line character is deleted, splicing physical source lines to form logical source lines. [SNIP]
The source file is decomposed into preprocessing tokens (2.5) and sequences of white-space characters (including comments). [SNIP]
Preprocessing directives are executed, macro invocations are expanded, and _Pragma unary operator expressions are executed. [SNIP]
Each source character set member in a character literal or a string literal, as well as each escape sequence and universal-character-name in a character literal or a non-raw string literal, is converted to the corresponding member of the execution character set; [SNIP]
Adjacent string literal tokens are concatenated.
White-space characters separating tokens are no longer significant. Each preprocessing token is converted into a token. (2.7). The resulting tokens are syntactically and semantically analyzed and translated as a translation unit. [SNIP]
Translated translation units and instantiation units are combined as follows: [SNIP]
All external entity references are resolved. Library components are linked to satisfy external references to entities not defined in the current translation. All such translator output is collected into a program image which contains information needed for execution in its execution environment. (emphasis mine)
[footnote] Implementations must behave as if these separate phases occur, although in practice different phases might be folded together.
The specified errors occur during this last stage of compilation, most commonly referred to as linking. It basically means that you compiled a bunch of implementation files into object files or libraries and now you want to get them to work together.
Say you defined symbol a in a.cpp. Now, b.cpp declared that symbol and used it. Before linking, it simply assumes that that symbol was defined somewhere, but it doesn't yet care where. The linking phase is responsible for finding the symbol and correctly linking it to b.cpp (well, actually to the object or library that uses it).
If you're using Microsoft Visual Studio, you'll see that projects generate .lib files. These contain a table of exported symbols, and a table of imported symbols. The imported symbols are resolved against the libraries you link against, and the exported symbols are provided for the libraries that use that .lib (if any).
Similar mechanisms exist for other compilers/ platforms.
Common error messages are error LNK2001, error LNK1120, error LNK2019 for Microsoft Visual Studio and undefined reference to symbolName for GCC.
The code:
struct X
{
   virtual void foo();
};
struct Y : X
{
   void foo() {}

struct A
{
   virtual ~A() = 0;

struct B: A

2386,12573816,Praetorian,241631,"Class members:
A pure virtual destructor needs an implementation.
Declaring a destructor pure still requires you to define it (unlike a regular function):
struct X
{
    virtual ~X() = 0;
};
struct Y : X
{
    ~Y() {}
};
int main()
{
    Y y;
}
//X::~X(){} //uncomment this line for successful definition
This happens because base class destructors are called when the object is destroyed implicitly, so a definition is required.
virtual methods must either be implemented or defined as pure.
This is similar to non-virtual methods with no definition, with the added reasoning that the pure declaration generates a dummy vtable and you might get the linker error without using the function:
struct X
{
    virtual void foo();
};
struct Y : X
{
   void foo() {}
};
int main()
{
   Y y; //linker error although there was no call to X::foo
}
For this to work, declare X::foo() as pure:
struct X
{
    virtual void foo() = 0;
};
Non-virtual class members
Some members need to be defined even if not used explicitly:
struct A
{ 
    ~A();
};
The following would yield the error:
A a;      //destructor undefined
The implementation can be inline, in the class definition itself:
struct A
{ 
    ~A() {}
};
or outside:
A::~A() {}
If the implementation is outside the class definition, but in a header, the methods have to be marked as inline to prevent a multiple definition.
All used member methods need to be defined if used.
A common mistake is forgetting to qualify the name:
struct A
{
   void foo();
};

void foo() {}

int main()
{
   A a;
   a.foo();
}
The definition should be
void A::foo() {}
static data members must be defined outside the class in a single translation unit:
struct X
{
    static int x;
};
int main()
{
    int x = X::x;
}
//int X::x; //uncomment this line to define X::x
An initializer can be provided for a static const data member of integral or enumeration type within the class definition; however, odr-use of this member will still require a namespace scope definition as described above. C++11 allows initialization inside the class for all static const data members.",2014-09-09 01:06:32Z,195
2387,12573816,HolyBlackCat,2752075,"Failure to link against appropriate libraries/object files or compile implementation files
Commonly, each translation unit will generate an object file that contains the definitions of the symbols defined in that translation unit. To use those symbols, you have to link against those object files.
Under gcc you would specify all object files that are to be linked together in the command line, or compile the implementation files together.
g++ -o test objectFile1.o objectFile2.o -lLibraryName
-l... must be to the right of any .o/.c/.cpp files.
The libraryName here is just the bare name of the library, without platform-specific additions. So e.g. on Linux library files are usually called libfoo.so but you'd only write -lfoo. On Windows that same file might be called foo.lib, but you'd use the same argument. You might have to add the directory where those files can be found using -L‹directory›. Make sure to not write a space after -l or -L.
For XCode: Add the User Header Search Paths -> add the Library Search Path -> drag and drop the actual library reference into the project folder.
Under MSVS, files added to a project automatically have their object files linked together and a lib file would be generated (in common usage). To use the symbols in a separate project, you'd need to include the lib files in the project settings. This is done in the Linker section of the project properties, in Input -> Additional Dependencies. (the path to the lib file should be added in Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories) When using a third-party library that is provided with a lib file, failure to do so usually results in the error.
It can also happen that you forget to add the file to the compilation, in which case the object file won't be generated. In gcc you'd add the files to the command line. In MSVS adding the file to the project will make it compile it automatically (albeit files can, manually, be individually excluded from the build).
In Windows programming, the tell-tale sign that you did not link a necessary library is that the name of the unresolved symbol begins with __imp_. Look up the name of the function in the documentation, and it should say which library you need to use. For example, MSDN puts the information in a box at the bottom of each function in a section called ""Library"".",2022-05-19 13:10:09Z,134
2388,12573816,Community,-1,"Declared but did not define a variable or function.
A typical variable declaration is
extern int x;
As this is only a declaration, a single definition is needed. A corresponding definition would be:
int x;
For example, the following would generate an error:
extern int x;
int main()
{
    x = 0;
}
//int x; // uncomment this line for successful definition
Similar remarks apply to functions. Declaring a function without defining it leads to the error:
void foo(); // declaration only
int main()
{
   foo();
}
//void foo() {} //uncomment this line for successful definition
Be careful that the function you implement exactly matches the one you declared. For example, you may have mismatched cv-qualifiers:
void foo(int& x);
int main()
{
   int x;
   foo(x);
}
void foo(const int& x) {} //different function, doesn't provide a definition
                          //for void foo(int& x)
                          
Other examples of mismatches include
Function/variable declared in one namespace, defined in another.
Function/variable declared as class member, defined as global (or vice versa).
Function return type, parameter number and types, and calling convention do not all exactly agree.
The error message from the compiler will often give you the full declaration of the variable or function that was declared but never defined. Compare it closely to the definition you provided. Make sure every detail matches.",2020-06-20 09:12:55Z,114

note: i use g++ and Linux and all examples is for it

// src1.cpp
void print();

static int local_var_name; // 'static' makes variable not visible for other modules
int global_var_name = 123;

int main()
{
    print();

void print ()
{
    // printf(""%d%d\n"", global_var_name, local_var_name);
    printf(""%d\n"", global_var_name);
}
Make object files
$ g++ -c src1.cpp -o src1.o
$ g++ -c src2.cpp -o src2.o
After the assembler phase we have an object file, which contains any symbols to export. Look at the symbols
$ readelf --symbols src1.o
  Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
     5: 0000000000000000     4 OBJECT  LOCAL  DEFAULT    4 _ZL14local_var_name # [1]
     9: 0000000000000000     4 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT    3 global_var_name     # [2]
I've rejected some lines from output, because they do not matter
So, we see follow symbols to export.
[1] - this is our static (local) variable (important - Bind has a type ""LOCAL"")
[2] - this is our global variable
src2.cpp exports nothing and we have seen no its symbols
Link our object files
$ g++ src1.o src2.o -o prog
and run it
$ ./prog
123
Linker sees exported symbols and links it. Now we try to uncomment lines in src2.cpp like here
// src2.cpp
extern ""C"" int printf (const char*, ...);

extern int global_var_name;
extern int local_var_name;

void print ()
{
    printf(""%d%d\n"", global_var_name, local_var_name);
}

$ g++ -c src2.cpp -o src2.o

src2.o: In function `print()':

It has happened because our local_var_name is static, i.e. it is not visible for other modules. Now more deeply. Get the translation phase output
$ g++ -S src1.cpp -o src1.s

// src1.s
look src1.s

I was recently able to get rid of an unresolved external error in Visual Studio 2012 just by recompiling the offending file. When I re-built, the error went away.
This usually happens when two (or more) libraries have a cyclic dependency. Library A attempts to use symbols in B.lib and library B attempts to use symbols from A.lib. Neither exist to start off with. When you attempt to compile A, the link step will fail because it can't find B.lib. A.lib will be generated, but no dll. You then compile B, which will succeed and generate B.lib. Re-compiling A will now work because B.lib is now found.",2013-12-03 20:56:14Z,74
2393,12573816,Community,-1,"Template implementations not visible.
Unspecialized templates must have their definitions visible to all translation units that use them. That means you can't separate the definition of a template to an implementation file. If you must separate the implementation, the usual workaround is to have an impl file which you include at the end of the header that declares the template. A common situation is:
template<class T>
struct X
{
    void foo();
};

int main()
{
    X<int> x;
    x.foo();
}

//differentImplementationFile.cpp
template<class T>
void X<T>::foo()
{
}
To fix this, you must move the definition of X::foo to the header file or some place visible to the translation unit that uses it.
Specialized templates can be implemented in an implementation file and the implementation doesn't have to be visible, but the specialization must be previously declared.

2394,12573816,Teivaz,3344612,"This is one of most confusing error messages that every VC++ programmers have seen time and time again. Let’s make things clarity first.
A. What is symbol? In short, a symbol is a name. It can be a variable name, a function name, a class name, a typedef name, or anything except those names and signs that belong to C++ language. It is user defined or introduced by a dependency library (another user-defined).
B. What is external? In VC++, every source file (.cpp,.c,etc.) is considered as a translation unit, the compiler compiles one unit at a time, and generate one object file(.obj) for the current translation unit. (Note that every header file that this source file included will be preprocessed and will be considered as part of this translation unit)Everything within a translation unit is considered as internal, everything else is considered as external. In C++, you may reference an external symbol by using keywords like extern, __declspec (dllimport) and so on.
C. What is “resolve”? Resolve is a linking-time term. In linking-time, linker attempts to find the external definition for every symbol in object files that cannot find its definition internally. The scope of this searching process including:
All object files that generated in compiling time
All libraries (.lib) that are either explicitly or implicitly specified as additional dependencies of this building application.
This searching process is called resolve.
D. Finally, why Unresolved External Symbol? If the linker cannot find the external definition for a symbol that has no definition internally, it reports an Unresolved External Symbol error.
E. Possible causes of LNK2019: Unresolved External Symbol error. We already know that this error is due to the linker failed to find the definition of external symbols, the possible causes can be sorted as:
Definition exists
For example, if we have a function called foo defined in a.cpp:
int foo()
{
    return 0;
}
In b.cpp we want to call function foo, so we add
void foo();
to declare function foo(), and call it in another function body, say bar():
void bar()
{
    foo();
}
Now when you build this code you will get a LNK2019 error complaining that foo is an unresolved symbol. In this case, we know that foo() has its definition in a.cpp, but different from the one we are calling(different return value). This is the case that definition exists.
Definition does not exist
If we want to call some functions in a library, but the import library is not added into the additional dependency list (set from: Project | Properties | Configuration Properties | Linker | Input | Additional Dependency) of your project setting. Now the linker will report a LNK2019 since the definition does not exist in current searching scope.",2017-11-08 09:05:14Z,65

MSVS requires you to specify which symbols to export and import using __declspec(dllexport) and __declspec(dllimport).

#ifdef THIS_MODULE
#define DLLIMPEXP __declspec(dllexport)
#else
#define DLLIMPEXP __declspec(dllimport)
#endif
The macro THIS_MODULE would only be defined in the module that exports the function. That way, the declaration:
DLLIMPEXP void foo();
expands to
__declspec(dllexport) void foo();
and tells the compiler to export the function, as the current module contains its definition. When including the declaration in a different module, it would expand to
__declspec(dllimport) void foo();

Let's says we are on Windows and we build our project in Visual Studio 20xx. When you press Ctrl + F7 Visual Studio to start compiling the whole solution ( suppose we have just one project in the solution )
What's the meaning of compilation ?
Visual Studio search into file .vcxproj and start compiling each file which has the extension .cpp. Order of compilation is undefined.So you must not assume that the file main.cpp is compiled first
If .cpp files depends on additional .h files in order to find symbols that may or may not be defined in the file .cpp
If exists one .cpp file in which the compiler could not find one symbol, a compiler time error raises the message Symbol x could not be found
For each file with extension .cpp is generated an object file .o and also Visual Studio writes the output in a file named ProjectName.Cpp.Clean.txt which contains all object files that must be processed by the linker.
The Second step of compilation is done by Linker.Linker should merge all the object file and build finally the output ( which may be an executable or a library)
Steps In Linking a project
Parse all the object files and find the definition which was only declared in headers ( eg: The code of one method of a class as is mentioned in previous answers, or event the initialization of a static variable which is member inside a class)
If one symbol could not be found in object files he also is searched in Additional Libraries.For adding a new library to a project Configuration properties -> VC++ Directories -> Library Directories and here you specified additional folder for searching libraries and Configuration properties -> Linker -> Input for specifying the name of the library. -If the Linker could not find the symbol which you write in one .cpp he raises a linker time error which may sound like error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol ""void __cdecl foo(void)"" (?foo@@YAXXZ)
Observation
Once the Linker find one symbol he doesn't search in other libraries for it
The order of linking libraries does matter.
If Linker finds an external symbol in one static library he includes the symbol in the output of the project.However, if the library is shared( dynamic ) he doesn't include the code ( symbols ) in output, but Run-Time crashes may occur
How To Solve this kind of error
Compiler Time Error :
Make sure you write your c++ project syntactical correct.
Linker Time Error
Define all your symbol which you declare in your header files
Use #pragma once for allowing compiler not to include one header if it was already included in the current .cpp which are compiled
Make sure that your external library doesn't contain symbols that may enter into conflict with other symbols you defined in your header files

One possible reason for linker errors with GCC 5.2.0 is that a new libstdc++ library ABI is now chosen by default.
If you get linker errors about undefined references to symbols that involve types in the std::__cxx11 namespace or the tag [abi:cxx11] then it probably indicates that you are trying to link together object files that were compiled with different values for the _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI macro. This commonly happens when linking to a third-party library that was compiled with an older version of GCC. If the third-party library cannot be rebuilt with the new ABI then you will need to recompile your code with the old ABI.
So if you suddenly get linker errors when switching to a GCC after 5.1.0 this would be a thing to check out.",2015-09-10 11:03:35Z,26

The explanation
Reading is optional from here on.
By default, a linkage command generated by GCC, on your distro, consumes the files in the linkage from left to right in commandline sequence. When it finds that a file refers to something and does not contain a definition for it, to will search for a definition in files further to the right. If it eventually finds a definition, the reference is resolved. If any references remain unresolved at the end, the linkage fails: the linker does not search backwards.
First, example 1, with static library my_lib.a
A static library is an indexed archive of object files. When the linker finds -lmy_lib in the linkage sequence and figures out that this refers to the static library ./libmy_lib.a, it wants to know whether your program needs any of the object files in libmy_lib.a.
There is only object file in libmy_lib.a, namely my_lib.o, and there's only one thing defined in my_lib.o, namely the function hw.
The linker will decide that your program needs my_lib.o if and only if it already knows that your program refers to hw, in one or more of the object files it has already added to the program, and that none of the object files it has already added contains a definition for hw.
If that is true, then the linker will extract a copy of my_lib.o from the library and add it to your program. Then, your program contains a definition for hw, so its references to hw are resolved.
When you try to link the program like:
$ gcc -o eg1 -L. -lmy_lib eg1.o
the linker has not added eg1.o to the program when it sees -lmy_lib. Because at that point, it has not seen eg1.o. Your program does not yet make any references to hw: it does not yet make any references at all, because all the references it makes are in eg1.o.
So the linker does not add my_lib.o to the program and has no further use for libmy_lib.a.
Next, it finds eg1.o, and adds it to be program. An object file in the linkage sequence is always added to the program. Now, the program makes a reference to hw, and does not contain a definition of hw; but there is nothing left in the linkage sequence that could provide the missing definition. The reference to hw ends up unresolved, and the linkage fails.
Second, example 2, with shared library libz
A shared library isn't an archive of object files or anything like it. It's much more like a program that doesn't have a main function and instead exposes multiple other symbols that it defines, so that other programs can use them at runtime.
Many Linux distros today configure their GCC toolchain so that its language drivers (gcc,g++,gfortran etc) instruct the system linker (ld) to link shared libraries on an as-needed basis. You have got one of those distros.
This means that when the linker finds -lz in the linkage sequence, and figures out that this refers to the shared library (say) /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so, it wants to know whether any references that it has added to your program that aren't yet defined have definitions that are exported by libz
If that is true, then the linker will not copy any chunks out of libz and add them to your program; instead, it will just doctor the code of your program so that:-
At runtime, the system program loader will load a copy of libz into the same process as your program whenever it loads a copy of your program, to run it.
At runtime, whenever your program refers to something that is defined in libz, that reference uses the definition exported by the copy of libz in the same process.
Your program wants to refer to just one thing that has a definition exported by libz, namely the function zlibVersion, which is referred to just once, in eg2.c. If the linker adds that reference to your program, and then finds the definition exported by libz, the reference is resolved
But when you try to link the program like:
gcc -o eg2 -lz eg2.o
the order of events is wrong in just the same way as with example 1. At the point when the linker finds -lz, there are no references to anything in the program: they are all in eg2.o, which has not yet been seen. So the linker decides it has no use for libz. When it reaches eg2.o, adds it to the program, and then has undefined reference to zlibVersion, the linkage sequence is finished; that reference is unresolved, and the linkage fails.
Lastly, the pkg-config variation of example 2 has a now obvious explanation. After shell-expansion:
gcc -o eg2 $(pkg-config --libs zlib) eg2.o
becomes:
gcc -o eg2 -lz eg2.o
which is just example 2 again.
I can reproduce the problem in example 1, but not in example 2
The linkage:
gcc -o eg2 -lz eg2.o
works just fine for you!
(Or: That linkage worked fine for you on, say, Fedora 23, but fails on Ubuntu 16.04)
That's because the distro on which the linkage works is one of the ones that does not configure its GCC toolchain to link shared libraries as-needed.
Back in the day, it was normal for unix-like systems to link static and shared libraries by different rules. Static libraries in a linkage sequence were linked on the as-needed basis explained in example 1, but shared libraries were linked unconditionally.
This behaviour is economical at linktime because the linker doesn't have to ponder whether a shared library is needed by the program: if it's a shared library, link it. And most libraries in most linkages are shared libraries. But there are disadvantages too:-
It is uneconomical at runtime, because it can cause shared libraries to be loaded along with a program even if doesn't need them.
The different linkage rules for static and shared libraries can be confusing to inexpert programmers, who may not know whether -lfoo in their linkage is going to resolve to /some/where/libfoo.a or to /some/where/libfoo.so, and might not understand the difference between shared and static libraries anyway.
This trade-off has led to the schismatic situation today. Some distros have changed their GCC linkage rules for shared libraries so that the as-needed principle applies for all libraries. Some distros have stuck with the old way.
Why do I still get this problem even if I compile-and-link at the same time?
If I just do:
$ gcc -o eg1 -I. -L. -lmy_lib eg1.c
surely gcc has to compile eg1.c first, and then link the resulting object file with libmy_lib.a. So how can it not know that object file is needed when it's doing the linking?
Because compiling and linking with a single command does not change the order of the linkage sequence.
When you run the command above, gcc figures out that you want compilation + linkage. So behind the scenes, it generates a compilation command, and runs it, then generates a linkage command, and runs it, as if you had run the two commands:
$ gcc -I. -c -o eg1.o eg1.c
$ gcc -o eg1 -L. -lmy_lib eg1.o
So the linkage fails just as it does if you do run those two commands. The only difference you notice in the failure is that gcc has generated a temporary object file in the compile + link case, because you're not telling it to use eg1.o. We see:
/tmp/ccQk1tvs.o: In function `main'
instead of:
eg1.o: In function `main':

The order in which interdependent linked libraries are specified is wrong
Putting interdependent libraries in the wrong order is just one way in which you can get files that need definitions of things coming later in the linkage than the files that provide the definitions. Putting libraries before the object files that refer to them is another way of making the same mistake.",2017-05-23 12:34:53Z,25

2407,12573816,Niall,3747990,"Befriending templates...
Given the code snippet of a template type with a friend operator (or function);
template <typename T>
class Foo {
    friend std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os, const Foo<T>& a);
};
The operator<< is being declared as a non-template function. For every type T used with Foo, there needs to be a non-templated operator<<. For example, if there is a type Foo<int> declared, then there must be an operator implementation as follows;
std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os, const Foo<int>& a) {/*...*/}
Since it is not implemented, the linker fails to find it and results in the error.
To correct this, you can declare a template operator before the Foo type and then declare as a friend, the appropriate instantiation. The syntax is a little awkward, but is looks as follows;
// forward declare the Foo
template <typename>
class Foo;

// forward declare the operator <<
template <typename T>
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream&, const Foo<T>&);

template <typename T>
class Foo {
    friend std::ostream& operator<< <>(std::ostream& os, const Foo<T>& a);
    // note the required <>        ^^^^
    // ...
};

template <typename T>
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream&, const Foo<T>&)
{
  // ... implement the operator
}
The above code limits the friendship of the operator to the corresponding instantiation of Foo, i.e. the operator<< <int> instantiation is limited to access the private members of the instantiation of Foo<int>.
Alternatives include;
Allowing the friendship to extend to all instantiations of the templates, as follows;
template <typename T>
class Foo {
    template <typename T1>
    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Foo<T1>& a);
    // ...
};
Or, the implementation for the operator<< can be done inline inside the class definition;
template <typename T>
class Foo {
    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Foo& a)
    { /*...*/ }
    // ...
};
Note, when the declaration of the operator (or function) only appears in the class, the name is not available for ""normal"" lookup, only for argument dependent lookup, from cppreference;
A name first declared in a friend declaration within class or class template X becomes a member of the innermost enclosing namespace of X, but is not accessible for lookup (except argument-dependent lookup that considers X) unless a matching declaration at the namespace scope is provided...
There is further reading on template friends at cppreference and the C++ FAQ.

2408,12573816,Community,-1,"When your include paths are different
Linker errors can happen when a header file and its associated shared library (.lib file) go out of sync. Let me explain.
How do linkers work? The linker matches a function declaration (declared in the header) with its definition (in the shared library) by comparing their signatures. You can get a linker error if the linker doesn't find a function definition that matches perfectly.
Is it possible to still get a linker error even though the declaration and the definition seem to match? Yes! They might look the same in source code, but it really depends on what the compiler sees. Essentially you could end up with a situation like this:
// header1.h
typedef int Number;
void foo(Number);

// header2.h
typedef float Number;
void foo(Number); // this only looks the same lexically
Note how even though both the function declarations look identical in source code, but they are really different according to the compiler.
You might ask how one ends up in a situation like that? Include paths of course! If when compiling the shared library, the include path leads to header1.h and you end up using header2.h in your own program, you'll be left scratching your header wondering what happened (pun intended).
An example of how this can happen in the real world is explained below.
Further elaboration with an example
I have two projects: graphics.lib and main.exe. Both projects depend on common_math.h. Suppose the library exports the following function:
// graphics.lib    
#include ""common_math.h"" 
   
void draw(vec3 p) { ... } // vec3 comes from common_math.h
And then you go ahead and include the library in your own project.
// main.exe
#include ""other/common_math.h""
#include ""graphics.h""

int main() {
    draw(...);
}
Boom! You get a linker error and you have no idea why it's failing. The reason is that the common library uses different versions of the same include common_math.h (I have made it obvious here in the example by including a different path, but it might not always be so obvious. Maybe the include path is different in the compiler settings).
Note in this example, the linker would tell you it couldn't find draw(), when in reality you know it obviously is being exported by the library. You could spend hours scratching your head wondering what went wrong. The thing is, the linker sees a different signature because the parameter types are slightly different. In the example, vec3 is a different type in both projects as far as the compiler is concerned. This could happen because they come from two slightly different include files (maybe the include files come from two different versions of the library).
Debugging the linker
DUMPBIN is your friend, if you are using Visual Studio. I'm sure other compilers have other similar tools.
The process goes like this:
Note the weird mangled name given in the linker error. (eg. draw@graphics@XYZ).
Dump the exported symbols from the library into a text file.
Search for the exported symbol of interest, and notice that the mangled name is different.
Pay attention to why the mangled names ended up different. You would be able to see that the parameter types are different, even though they look the same in the source code.
Reason why they are different. In the example given above, they are different because of different include files.
[1] By project I mean a set of source files that are linked together to produce either a library or an executable.

2409,12573816,Niall,3747990,"Inconsistent UNICODE definitions
A Windows UNICODE build is built with TCHAR etc. being defined as wchar_t etc. When not building with UNICODE defined as build with TCHAR defined as char etc. These UNICODE and _UNICODE defines affect all the ""T"" string types; LPTSTR, LPCTSTR and their elk.
Building one library with UNICODE defined and attempting to link it in a project where UNICODE is not defined will result in linker errors since there will be a mismatch in the definition of TCHAR; char vs. wchar_t.
The error usually includes a function a value with a char or wchar_t derived type, these could include std::basic_string<> etc. as well. When browsing through the affected function in the code, there will often be a reference to TCHAR or std::basic_string<TCHAR> etc. This is a tell-tale sign that the code was originally intended for both a UNICODE and a Multi-Byte Character (or ""narrow"") build.
To correct this, build all the required libraries and projects with a consistent definition of UNICODE (and _UNICODE).
This can be done with either;
#define UNICODE
#define _UNICODE
Or in the project settings;
Project Properties > General > Project Defaults > Character Set
Or on the command line;
/DUNICODE /D_UNICODE

Different versions of libraries
I was using an alias to refer to std::filesystem::path: filesystem is in the standard library since C++17 but my program needed to also compile in C++14 so I decided to use a variable alias:
#if (defined _GLIBCXX_EXPERIMENTAL_FILESYSTEM) //is the included filesystem library experimental? (C++14 and newer: <experimental/filesystem>)
using path_t = std::experimental::filesystem::path;
#elif (defined _GLIBCXX_FILESYSTEM) //not experimental (C++17 and newer: <filesystem>)
using path_t = std::filesystem::path;
#endif
Let's say I have three files: main.cpp, file.h, file.cpp:
file.h #include's <experimental::filesystem> and contains the code above
file.cpp, the implementation of file.h, #include's ""file.h""
main.cpp #include's <filesystem> and ""file.h""
Note the different libraries used in main.cpp and file.h. Since main.cpp #include'd ""file.h"" after <filesystem>, the version of filesystem used there was the C++17 one. I used to compile the program with the following commands:
$ g++ -g -std=c++17 -c main.cpp -> compiles main.cpp to main.o
$ g++ -g -std=c++17 -c file.cpp -> compiles file.cpp and file.h to file.o
$ g++ -g -std=c++17 -o executable main.o file.o -lstdc++fs -> links main.o and file.o
This way any function contained in file.o and used in main.o that required path_t gave ""undefined reference"" errors because main.o referred to std::filesystem::path but file.o to std::experimental::filesystem::path.

To fix this I just needed to change <experimental::filesystem> in file.h to <filesystem>.",2019-07-29 13:01:59Z,10
2413,12573816,ead,5769463,"When linking against shared libraries, make sure that the used symbols are not hidden.
The default behavior of gcc is that all symbols are visible. However, when the translation units are built with option -fvisibility=hidden, only functions/symbols marked with __attribute__ ((visibility (""default""))) are external in the resulting shared object.
You can check whether the symbols your are looking for are external by invoking:
# -D shows (global) dynamic symbols that can be used from the outside of XXX.so
nm -D XXX.so | grep MY_SYMBOL 
the hidden/local symbols are shown by nm with lowercase symbol type, for example t instead of `T for code-section:
nm XXX.so
00000000000005a7 t HIDDEN_SYMBOL
00000000000005f8 T VISIBLE_SYMBOL
You can also use nm with the option -C to demangle the names (if C++ was used).
Similar to Windows-dlls, one would mark public functions with a define, for example DLL_PUBLIC defined as:
#define DLL_PUBLIC __attribute__ ((visibility (""default"")))

DLL_PUBLIC int my_public_function(){
  ...
}
Which roughly corresponds to Windows'/MSVC-version:
#ifdef BUILDING_DLL
    #define DLL_PUBLIC __declspec(dllexport) 
#else
    #define DLL_PUBLIC __declspec(dllimport) 
#endif
More information about visibility can be found on the gcc wiki.
When a translation unit is compiled with -fvisibility=hidden the resulting symbols have still external linkage (shown with upper case symbol type by nm) and can be used for external linkage without problem if the object files become part of a static libraries. The linkage becomes local only when the object files are linked into a shared library.
To find which symbols in an object file are hidden run:

not emitting any symbol by which the linker can refer to the definition of gum, and instead
replacing all calls to gum with inline copies of the compiled body of gum.
As a result, if you define gum inline in a source file gum.cpp, it is compiled to an object file gum.o in which all calls to gum are inlined and no symbol is defined by which the linker can refer to gum. When you link gum.o into a program together with another object file, e.g. main.o that make references to an external symbol gum, the linker cannot resolve those references. So the linkage fails:

You can only define gum as inline if the compiler can see its definition in every source file in which gum may be called. That means its inline definition needs to exist in a header file that you include in every source file you compile in which gum may be called. Do one of two things:
Either don't inline the definitions
Remove the inline specifier from the source file definition:
foo.cpp (2)
#include ""foo.h""
#include <iostream>

void foo::bar() const {
    std::cout << __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ << std::endl;
}
gum.cpp (2)
#include ""gum.h""
#include <iostream>

void gum()
{
    std::cout << __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ << std::endl;
}
Rebuild with that:
$ g++ -c  main.cpp foo.cpp gum.cpp
imk@imk-Inspiron-7559:~/develop/so/scrap1$ g++ -o prog main.o foo.o gum.o
imk@imk-Inspiron-7559:~/develop/so/scrap1$ ./prog
void gum()
void foo::bar() const
Success.
Or inline correctly
Inline definitions in header files:
foo.h (2)
#pragma once
#include <iostream>

struct foo {
    void bar() const  { // In-class definition is implicitly inline
        std::cout << __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ << std::endl;
    }
};
// Alternatively...
#if 0
struct foo {
    void bar() const;
};
inline void foo::bar() const  {
    std::cout << __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ << std::endl;
}
#endif
gum.h (2)
#pragma once
#include <iostream>

inline void gum() {
    std::cout << __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ << std::endl;
}
Now we don't need foo.cpp or gum.cpp:
$ g++ -c main.cpp
$ g++ -o prog main.o
$ ./prog

The precedence among the syntax rules of translation is specified by the following phases [see footnote].
Physical source file characters are mapped, in an implementation-defined manner, to the basic source character set (introducing new-line characters for end-of-line indicators) if necessary. [SNIP]
Each instance of a backslash character (\) immediately followed by a new-line character is deleted, splicing physical source lines to form logical source lines. [SNIP]
The source file is decomposed into preprocessing tokens (2.5) and sequences of white-space characters (including comments). [SNIP]
Preprocessing directives are executed, macro invocations are expanded, and _Pragma unary operator expressions are executed. [SNIP]
Each source character set member in a character literal or a string literal, as well as each escape sequence and universal-character-name in a character literal or a non-raw string literal, is converted to the corresponding member of the execution character set; [SNIP]
Adjacent string literal tokens are concatenated.
White-space characters separating tokens are no longer significant. Each preprocessing token is converted into a token. (2.7). The resulting tokens are syntactically and semantically analyzed and translated as a translation unit. [SNIP]
Translated translation units and instantiation units are combined as follows: [SNIP]
All external entity references are resolved. Library components are linked to satisfy external references to entities not defined in the current translation. All such translator output is collected into a program image which contains information needed for execution in its execution environment. (emphasis mine)
[footnote] Implementations must behave as if these separate phases occur, although in practice different phases might be folded together.
The specified errors occur during this last stage of compilation, most commonly referred to as linking. It basically means that you compiled a bunch of implementation files into object files or libraries and now you want to get them to work together.
Say you defined symbol a in a.cpp. Now, b.cpp declared that symbol and used it. Before linking, it simply assumes that that symbol was defined somewhere, but it doesn't yet care where. The linking phase is responsible for finding the symbol and correctly linking it to b.cpp (well, actually to the object or library that uses it).
If you're using Microsoft Visual Studio, you'll see that projects generate .lib files. These contain a table of exported symbols, and a table of imported symbols. The imported symbols are resolved against the libraries you link against, and the exported symbols are provided for the libraries that use that .lib (if any).
Similar mechanisms exist for other compilers/ platforms.
Common error messages are error LNK2001, error LNK1120, error LNK2019 for Microsoft Visual Studio and undefined reference to symbolName for GCC.

2418,12573816,Praetorian,241631,"Class members:
A pure virtual destructor needs an implementation.
Declaring a destructor pure still requires you to define it (unlike a regular function):
struct X
{
    virtual ~X() = 0;
};
struct Y : X
{
    ~Y() {}
};
int main()
{
    Y y;
}
//X::~X(){} //uncomment this line for successful definition
This happens because base class destructors are called when the object is destroyed implicitly, so a definition is required.
virtual methods must either be implemented or defined as pure.
This is similar to non-virtual methods with no definition, with the added reasoning that the pure declaration generates a dummy vtable and you might get the linker error without using the function:
struct X
{
    virtual void foo();
};
struct Y : X
{
   void foo() {}
};
int main()
{
   Y y; //linker error although there was no call to X::foo
}
For this to work, declare X::foo() as pure:
struct X
{
    virtual void foo() = 0;
};
Non-virtual class members
Some members need to be defined even if not used explicitly:
struct A
{ 
    ~A();
};
The following would yield the error:
A a;      //destructor undefined
The implementation can be inline, in the class definition itself:
struct A
{ 
    ~A() {}
};
or outside:
A::~A() {}
If the implementation is outside the class definition, but in a header, the methods have to be marked as inline to prevent a multiple definition.
All used member methods need to be defined if used.
A common mistake is forgetting to qualify the name:
struct A
{
   void foo();
};

void foo() {}

int main()
{
   A a;
   a.foo();
}
The definition should be
void A::foo() {}
static data members must be defined outside the class in a single translation unit:
struct X
{
    static int x;
};
int main()
{
    int x = X::x;
}
//int X::x; //uncomment this line to define X::x
An initializer can be provided for a static const data member of integral or enumeration type within the class definition; however, odr-use of this member will still require a namespace scope definition as described above. C++11 allows initialization inside the class for all static const data members.",2014-09-09 01:06:32Z,195
2419,12573816,HolyBlackCat,2752075,"Failure to link against appropriate libraries/object files or compile implementation files
Commonly, each translation unit will generate an object file that contains the definitions of the symbols defined in that translation unit. To use those symbols, you have to link against those object files.
Under gcc you would specify all object files that are to be linked together in the command line, or compile the implementation files together.
g++ -o test objectFile1.o objectFile2.o -lLibraryName
-l... must be to the right of any .o/.c/.cpp files.
The libraryName here is just the bare name of the library, without platform-specific additions. So e.g. on Linux library files are usually called libfoo.so but you'd only write -lfoo. On Windows that same file might be called foo.lib, but you'd use the same argument. You might have to add the directory where those files can be found using -L‹directory›. Make sure to not write a space after -l or -L.
For XCode: Add the User Header Search Paths -> add the Library Search Path -> drag and drop the actual library reference into the project folder.
Under MSVS, files added to a project automatically have their object files linked together and a lib file would be generated (in common usage). To use the symbols in a separate project, you'd need to include the lib files in the project settings. This is done in the Linker section of the project properties, in Input -> Additional Dependencies. (the path to the lib file should be added in Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories) When using a third-party library that is provided with a lib file, failure to do so usually results in the error.
It can also happen that you forget to add the file to the compilation, in which case the object file won't be generated. In gcc you'd add the files to the command line. In MSVS adding the file to the project will make it compile it automatically (albeit files can, manually, be individually excluded from the build).
In Windows programming, the tell-tale sign that you did not link a necessary library is that the name of the unresolved symbol begins with __imp_. Look up the name of the function in the documentation, and it should say which library you need to use. For example, MSDN puts the information in a box at the bottom of each function in a section called ""Library"".",2022-05-19 13:10:09Z,134
2420,12573816,Community,-1,"Declared but did not define a variable or function.
A typical variable declaration is
extern int x;
As this is only a declaration, a single definition is needed. A corresponding definition would be:
int x;
For example, the following would generate an error:
extern int x;
int main()
{
    x = 0;
}
//int x; // uncomment this line for successful definition
Similar remarks apply to functions. Declaring a function without defining it leads to the error:
void foo(); // declaration only
int main()
{
   foo();
}
//void foo() {} //uncomment this line for successful definition
Be careful that the function you implement exactly matches the one you declared. For example, you may have mismatched cv-qualifiers:
void foo(int& x);
int main()
{
   int x;
   foo(x);
}
void foo(const int& x) {} //different function, doesn't provide a definition
                          //for void foo(int& x)
                          
Other examples of mismatches include
Function/variable declared in one namespace, defined in another.
Function/variable declared as class member, defined as global (or vice versa).
Function return type, parameter number and types, and calling convention do not all exactly agree.
The error message from the compiler will often give you the full declaration of the variable or function that was declared but never defined. Compare it closely to the definition you provided. Make sure every detail matches.",2020-06-20 09:12:55Z,114
2421,12573816,Community,-1,"The order in which interdependent linked libraries are specified is wrong.

int main()
{
    print();

    printf(""%d\n"", global_var_name);
}
Make object files
$ g++ -c src1.cpp -o src1.o
$ g++ -c src2.cpp -o src2.o
After the assembler phase we have an object file, which contains any symbols to export. Look at the symbols
$ readelf --symbols src1.o
  Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name

     9: 0000000000000000     4 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT    3 global_var_name     # [2]
I've rejected some lines from output, because they do not matter
So, we see follow symbols to export.
[1] - this is our static (local) variable (important - Bind has a type ""LOCAL"")
[2] - this is our global variable
src2.cpp exports nothing and we have seen no its symbols
Link our object files
$ g++ src1.o src2.o -o prog
and run it
$ ./prog

Linker sees exported symbols and links it. Now we try to uncomment lines in src2.cpp like here
// src2.cpp
extern ""C"" int printf (const char*, ...);

extern int global_var_name;
extern int local_var_name;

void print ()
{
    printf(""%d%d\n"", global_var_name, local_var_name);
}

src2.o: In function `print()':

It has happened because our local_var_name is static, i.e. it is not visible for other modules. Now more deeply. Get the translation phase output

// src1.s
look src1.s

I was recently able to get rid of an unresolved external error in Visual Studio 2012 just by recompiling the offending file. When I re-built, the error went away.
This usually happens when two (or more) libraries have a cyclic dependency. Library A attempts to use symbols in B.lib and library B attempts to use symbols from A.lib. Neither exist to start off with. When you attempt to compile A, the link step will fail because it can't find B.lib. A.lib will be generated, but no dll. You then compile B, which will succeed and generate B.lib. Re-compiling A will now work because B.lib is now found.",2013-12-03 20:56:14Z,74

Unspecialized templates must have their definitions visible to all translation units that use them. That means you can't separate the definition of a template to an implementation file. If you must separate the implementation, the usual workaround is to have an impl file which you include at the end of the header that declares the template. A common situation is:
template<class T>
struct X
{
    void foo();
};

int main()
{
    X<int> x;
    x.foo();
}

//differentImplementationFile.cpp
template<class T>
void X<T>::foo()

}
To fix this, you must move the definition of X::foo to the header file or some place visible to the translation unit that uses it.
Specialized templates can be implemented in an implementation file and the implementation doesn't have to be visible, but the specialization must be previously declared.

2426,12573816,Teivaz,3344612,"This is one of most confusing error messages that every VC++ programmers have seen time and time again. Let’s make things clarity first.
A. What is symbol? In short, a symbol is a name. It can be a variable name, a function name, a class name, a typedef name, or anything except those names and signs that belong to C++ language. It is user defined or introduced by a dependency library (another user-defined).
B. What is external? In VC++, every source file (.cpp,.c,etc.) is considered as a translation unit, the compiler compiles one unit at a time, and generate one object file(.obj) for the current translation unit. (Note that every header file that this source file included will be preprocessed and will be considered as part of this translation unit)Everything within a translation unit is considered as internal, everything else is considered as external. In C++, you may reference an external symbol by using keywords like extern, __declspec (dllimport) and so on.
C. What is “resolve”? Resolve is a linking-time term. In linking-time, linker attempts to find the external definition for every symbol in object files that cannot find its definition internally. The scope of this searching process including:
All object files that generated in compiling time
All libraries (.lib) that are either explicitly or implicitly specified as additional dependencies of this building application.
This searching process is called resolve.
D. Finally, why Unresolved External Symbol? If the linker cannot find the external definition for a symbol that has no definition internally, it reports an Unresolved External Symbol error.
E. Possible causes of LNK2019: Unresolved External Symbol error. We already know that this error is due to the linker failed to find the definition of external symbols, the possible causes can be sorted as:
Definition exists
For example, if we have a function called foo defined in a.cpp:
int foo()
{
    return 0;
}
In b.cpp we want to call function foo, so we add
void foo();
to declare function foo(), and call it in another function body, say bar():
void bar()
{
    foo();
}
Now when you build this code you will get a LNK2019 error complaining that foo is an unresolved symbol. In this case, we know that foo() has its definition in a.cpp, but different from the one we are calling(different return value). This is the case that definition exists.
Definition does not exist
If we want to call some functions in a library, but the import library is not added into the additional dependency list (set from: Project | Properties | Configuration Properties | Linker | Input | Additional Dependency) of your project setting. Now the linker will report a LNK2019 since the definition does not exist in current searching scope.",2017-11-08 09:05:14Z,65
2427,12573816,Community,-1,"Incorrectly importing/exporting methods/classes across modules/dll (compiler specific).
MSVS requires you to specify which symbols to export and import using __declspec(dllexport) and __declspec(dllimport).
This dual functionality is usually obtained through the use of a macro:
#ifdef THIS_MODULE
#define DLLIMPEXP __declspec(dllexport)
#else
#define DLLIMPEXP __declspec(dllimport)
#endif
The macro THIS_MODULE would only be defined in the module that exports the function. That way, the declaration:
DLLIMPEXP void foo();
expands to
__declspec(dllexport) void foo();
and tells the compiler to export the function, as the current module contains its definition. When including the declaration in a different module, it would expand to
__declspec(dllimport) void foo();

2432,12573816,Farzad Karimi,956198,"Suppose you have a big project written in c++ which has a thousand of .cpp files and a thousand of .h files.And let's says the project also depends on ten static libraries. Let's says we are on Windows and we build our project in Visual Studio 20xx. When you press Ctrl + F7 Visual Studio to start compiling the whole solution ( suppose we have just one project in the solution )
What's the meaning of compilation ?
Visual Studio search into file .vcxproj and start compiling each file which has the extension .cpp. Order of compilation is undefined.So you must not assume that the file main.cpp is compiled first
If .cpp files depends on additional .h files in order to find symbols that may or may not be defined in the file .cpp
If exists one .cpp file in which the compiler could not find one symbol, a compiler time error raises the message Symbol x could not be found
For each file with extension .cpp is generated an object file .o and also Visual Studio writes the output in a file named ProjectName.Cpp.Clean.txt which contains all object files that must be processed by the linker.
The Second step of compilation is done by Linker.Linker should merge all the object file and build finally the output ( which may be an executable or a library)
Steps In Linking a project
Parse all the object files and find the definition which was only declared in headers ( eg: The code of one method of a class as is mentioned in previous answers, or event the initialization of a static variable which is member inside a class)
If one symbol could not be found in object files he also is searched in Additional Libraries.For adding a new library to a project Configuration properties -> VC++ Directories -> Library Directories and here you specified additional folder for searching libraries and Configuration properties -> Linker -> Input for specifying the name of the library. -If the Linker could not find the symbol which you write in one .cpp he raises a linker time error which may sound like error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol ""void __cdecl foo(void)"" (?foo@@YAXXZ)
Observation
Once the Linker find one symbol he doesn't search in other libraries for it
The order of linking libraries does matter.
If Linker finds an external symbol in one static library he includes the symbol in the output of the project.However, if the library is shared( dynamic ) he doesn't include the code ( symbols ) in output, but Run-Time crashes may occur
How To Solve this kind of error
Compiler Time Error :
Make sure you write your c++ project syntactical correct.
Linker Time Error
Define all your symbol which you declare in your header files
Use #pragma once for allowing compiler not to include one header if it was already included in the current .cpp which are compiled
Make sure that your external library doesn't contain symbols that may enter into conflict with other symbols you defined in your header files
When you use the template to make sure you include the definition of each template function in the header file for allowing the compiler to generate appropriate code for any instantiations.",2017-11-08 10:15:57Z,36

If you get linker errors about undefined references to symbols that involve types in the std::__cxx11 namespace or the tag [abi:cxx11] then it probably indicates that you are trying to link together object files that were compiled with different values for the _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI macro. This commonly happens when linking to a third-party library that was compiled with an older version of GCC. If the third-party library cannot be rebuilt with the new ABI then you will need to recompile your code with the old ABI.

The explanation
Reading is optional from here on.
By default, a linkage command generated by GCC, on your distro, consumes the files in the linkage from left to right in commandline sequence. When it finds that a file refers to something and does not contain a definition for it, to will search for a definition in files further to the right. If it eventually finds a definition, the reference is resolved. If any references remain unresolved at the end, the linkage fails: the linker does not search backwards.
First, example 1, with static library my_lib.a
A static library is an indexed archive of object files. When the linker finds -lmy_lib in the linkage sequence and figures out that this refers to the static library ./libmy_lib.a, it wants to know whether your program needs any of the object files in libmy_lib.a.
There is only object file in libmy_lib.a, namely my_lib.o, and there's only one thing defined in my_lib.o, namely the function hw.
The linker will decide that your program needs my_lib.o if and only if it already knows that your program refers to hw, in one or more of the object files it has already added to the program, and that none of the object files it has already added contains a definition for hw.
If that is true, then the linker will extract a copy of my_lib.o from the library and add it to your program. Then, your program contains a definition for hw, so its references to hw are resolved.
When you try to link the program like:
$ gcc -o eg1 -L. -lmy_lib eg1.o
the linker has not added eg1.o to the program when it sees -lmy_lib. Because at that point, it has not seen eg1.o. Your program does not yet make any references to hw: it does not yet make any references at all, because all the references it makes are in eg1.o.
So the linker does not add my_lib.o to the program and has no further use for libmy_lib.a.
Next, it finds eg1.o, and adds it to be program. An object file in the linkage sequence is always added to the program. Now, the program makes a reference to hw, and does not contain a definition of hw; but there is nothing left in the linkage sequence that could provide the missing definition. The reference to hw ends up unresolved, and the linkage fails.
Second, example 2, with shared library libz
A shared library isn't an archive of object files or anything like it. It's much more like a program that doesn't have a main function and instead exposes multiple other symbols that it defines, so that other programs can use them at runtime.
Many Linux distros today configure their GCC toolchain so that its language drivers (gcc,g++,gfortran etc) instruct the system linker (ld) to link shared libraries on an as-needed basis. You have got one of those distros.
This means that when the linker finds -lz in the linkage sequence, and figures out that this refers to the shared library (say) /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so, it wants to know whether any references that it has added to your program that aren't yet defined have definitions that are exported by libz
If that is true, then the linker will not copy any chunks out of libz and add them to your program; instead, it will just doctor the code of your program so that:-
At runtime, the system program loader will load a copy of libz into the same process as your program whenever it loads a copy of your program, to run it.
At runtime, whenever your program refers to something that is defined in libz, that reference uses the definition exported by the copy of libz in the same process.
Your program wants to refer to just one thing that has a definition exported by libz, namely the function zlibVersion, which is referred to just once, in eg2.c. If the linker adds that reference to your program, and then finds the definition exported by libz, the reference is resolved
But when you try to link the program like:
gcc -o eg2 -lz eg2.o
the order of events is wrong in just the same way as with example 1. At the point when the linker finds -lz, there are no references to anything in the program: they are all in eg2.o, which has not yet been seen. So the linker decides it has no use for libz. When it reaches eg2.o, adds it to the program, and then has undefined reference to zlibVersion, the linkage sequence is finished; that reference is unresolved, and the linkage fails.
Lastly, the pkg-config variation of example 2 has a now obvious explanation. After shell-expansion:
gcc -o eg2 $(pkg-config --libs zlib) eg2.o
becomes:
gcc -o eg2 -lz eg2.o
which is just example 2 again.
I can reproduce the problem in example 1, but not in example 2
The linkage:
gcc -o eg2 -lz eg2.o
works just fine for you!
(Or: That linkage worked fine for you on, say, Fedora 23, but fails on Ubuntu 16.04)
That's because the distro on which the linkage works is one of the ones that does not configure its GCC toolchain to link shared libraries as-needed.
Back in the day, it was normal for unix-like systems to link static and shared libraries by different rules. Static libraries in a linkage sequence were linked on the as-needed basis explained in example 1, but shared libraries were linked unconditionally.
This behaviour is economical at linktime because the linker doesn't have to ponder whether a shared library is needed by the program: if it's a shared library, link it. And most libraries in most linkages are shared libraries. But there are disadvantages too:-
It is uneconomical at runtime, because it can cause shared libraries to be loaded along with a program even if doesn't need them.
The different linkage rules for static and shared libraries can be confusing to inexpert programmers, who may not know whether -lfoo in their linkage is going to resolve to /some/where/libfoo.a or to /some/where/libfoo.so, and might not understand the difference between shared and static libraries anyway.
This trade-off has led to the schismatic situation today. Some distros have changed their GCC linkage rules for shared libraries so that the as-needed principle applies for all libraries. Some distros have stuck with the old way.
Why do I still get this problem even if I compile-and-link at the same time?
If I just do:
$ gcc -o eg1 -I. -L. -lmy_lib eg1.c
surely gcc has to compile eg1.c first, and then link the resulting object file with libmy_lib.a. So how can it not know that object file is needed when it's doing the linking?
Because compiling and linking with a single command does not change the order of the linkage sequence.
When you run the command above, gcc figures out that you want compilation + linkage. So behind the scenes, it generates a compilation command, and runs it, then generates a linkage command, and runs it, as if you had run the two commands:
$ gcc -I. -c -o eg1.o eg1.c
$ gcc -o eg1 -L. -lmy_lib eg1.o
So the linkage fails just as it does if you do run those two commands. The only difference you notice in the failure is that gcc has generated a temporary object file in the compile + link case, because you're not telling it to use eg1.o. We see:
/tmp/ccQk1tvs.o: In function `main'
instead of:
eg1.o: In function `main':

The order in which interdependent linked libraries are specified is wrong
Putting interdependent libraries in the wrong order is just one way in which you can get files that need definitions of things coming later in the linkage than the files that provide the definitions. Putting libraries before the object files that refer to them is another way of making the same mistake.",2017-05-23 12:34:53Z,25

2439,12573816,Niall,3747990,"Befriending templates...
Given the code snippet of a template type with a friend operator (or function);
template <typename T>
class Foo {
    friend std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os, const Foo<T>& a);
};
The operator<< is being declared as a non-template function. For every type T used with Foo, there needs to be a non-templated operator<<. For example, if there is a type Foo<int> declared, then there must be an operator implementation as follows;
std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os, const Foo<int>& a) {/*...*/}
Since it is not implemented, the linker fails to find it and results in the error.
To correct this, you can declare a template operator before the Foo type and then declare as a friend, the appropriate instantiation. The syntax is a little awkward, but is looks as follows;
// forward declare the Foo
template <typename>
class Foo;

// forward declare the operator <<
template <typename T>
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream&, const Foo<T>&);

template <typename T>
class Foo {
    friend std::ostream& operator<< <>(std::ostream& os, const Foo<T>& a);
    // note the required <>        ^^^^
    // ...
};

template <typename T>
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream&, const Foo<T>&)
{
  // ... implement the operator
}
The above code limits the friendship of the operator to the corresponding instantiation of Foo, i.e. the operator<< <int> instantiation is limited to access the private members of the instantiation of Foo<int>.
Alternatives include;
Allowing the friendship to extend to all instantiations of the templates, as follows;
template <typename T>
class Foo {
    template <typename T1>
    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Foo<T1>& a);
    // ...
};
Or, the implementation for the operator<< can be done inline inside the class definition;
template <typename T>
class Foo {
    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Foo& a)
    { /*...*/ }
    // ...
};
Note, when the declaration of the operator (or function) only appears in the class, the name is not available for ""normal"" lookup, only for argument dependent lookup, from cppreference;
A name first declared in a friend declaration within class or class template X becomes a member of the innermost enclosing namespace of X, but is not accessible for lookup (except argument-dependent lookup that considers X) unless a matching declaration at the namespace scope is provided...
There is further reading on template friends at cppreference and the C++ FAQ.

2440,12573816,Community,-1,"When your include paths are different
Linker errors can happen when a header file and its associated shared library (.lib file) go out of sync. Let me explain.
How do linkers work? The linker matches a function declaration (declared in the header) with its definition (in the shared library) by comparing their signatures. You can get a linker error if the linker doesn't find a function definition that matches perfectly.
Is it possible to still get a linker error even though the declaration and the definition seem to match? Yes! They might look the same in source code, but it really depends on what the compiler sees. Essentially you could end up with a situation like this:
// header1.h
typedef int Number;
void foo(Number);

// header2.h
typedef float Number;
void foo(Number); // this only looks the same lexically
Note how even though both the function declarations look identical in source code, but they are really different according to the compiler.
You might ask how one ends up in a situation like that? Include paths of course! If when compiling the shared library, the include path leads to header1.h and you end up using header2.h in your own program, you'll be left scratching your header wondering what happened (pun intended).
An example of how this can happen in the real world is explained below.
Further elaboration with an example
I have two projects: graphics.lib and main.exe. Both projects depend on common_math.h. Suppose the library exports the following function:
// graphics.lib    
#include ""common_math.h"" 
   
void draw(vec3 p) { ... } // vec3 comes from common_math.h
And then you go ahead and include the library in your own project.
// main.exe
#include ""other/common_math.h""
#include ""graphics.h""

int main() {
    draw(...);
}
Boom! You get a linker error and you have no idea why it's failing. The reason is that the common library uses different versions of the same include common_math.h (I have made it obvious here in the example by including a different path, but it might not always be so obvious. Maybe the include path is different in the compiler settings).
Note in this example, the linker would tell you it couldn't find draw(), when in reality you know it obviously is being exported by the library. You could spend hours scratching your head wondering what went wrong. The thing is, the linker sees a different signature because the parameter types are slightly different. In the example, vec3 is a different type in both projects as far as the compiler is concerned. This could happen because they come from two slightly different include files (maybe the include files come from two different versions of the library).
Debugging the linker
DUMPBIN is your friend, if you are using Visual Studio. I'm sure other compilers have other similar tools.
The process goes like this:
Note the weird mangled name given in the linker error. (eg. draw@graphics@XYZ).
Dump the exported symbols from the library into a text file.
Search for the exported symbol of interest, and notice that the mangled name is different.
Pay attention to why the mangled names ended up different. You would be able to see that the parameter types are different, even though they look the same in the source code.
Reason why they are different. In the example given above, they are different because of different include files.
[1] By project I mean a set of source files that are linked together to produce either a library or an executable.

2441,12573816,Niall,3747990,"Inconsistent UNICODE definitions
A Windows UNICODE build is built with TCHAR etc. being defined as wchar_t etc. When not building with UNICODE defined as build with TCHAR defined as char etc. These UNICODE and _UNICODE defines affect all the ""T"" string types; LPTSTR, LPCTSTR and their elk.
Building one library with UNICODE defined and attempting to link it in a project where UNICODE is not defined will result in linker errors since there will be a mismatch in the definition of TCHAR; char vs. wchar_t.
The error usually includes a function a value with a char or wchar_t derived type, these could include std::basic_string<> etc. as well. When browsing through the affected function in the code, there will often be a reference to TCHAR or std::basic_string<TCHAR> etc. This is a tell-tale sign that the code was originally intended for both a UNICODE and a Multi-Byte Character (or ""narrow"") build.
To correct this, build all the required libraries and projects with a consistent definition of UNICODE (and _UNICODE).
This can be done with either;
#define UNICODE
#define _UNICODE

Project Properties > General > Project Defaults > Character Set
Or on the command line;

Let's say I have three files: main.cpp, file.h, file.cpp:
file.h #include's <experimental::filesystem> and contains the code above
file.cpp, the implementation of file.h, #include's ""file.h""
main.cpp #include's <filesystem> and ""file.h""
Note the different libraries used in main.cpp and file.h. Since main.cpp #include'd ""file.h"" after <filesystem>, the version of filesystem used there was the C++17 one. I used to compile the program with the following commands:
$ g++ -g -std=c++17 -c main.cpp -> compiles main.cpp to main.o
$ g++ -g -std=c++17 -c file.cpp -> compiles file.cpp and file.h to file.o
$ g++ -g -std=c++17 -o executable main.o file.o -lstdc++fs -> links main.o and file.o
This way any function contained in file.o and used in main.o that required path_t gave ""undefined reference"" errors because main.o referred to std::filesystem::path but file.o to std::experimental::filesystem::path.
Resolution
To fix this I just needed to change <experimental::filesystem> in file.h to <filesystem>.",2019-07-29 13:01:59Z,10
2445,12573816,ead,5769463,"When linking against shared libraries, make sure that the used symbols are not hidden.
The default behavior of gcc is that all symbols are visible. However, when the translation units are built with option -fvisibility=hidden, only functions/symbols marked with __attribute__ ((visibility (""default""))) are external in the resulting shared object.
You can check whether the symbols your are looking for are external by invoking:
# -D shows (global) dynamic symbols that can be used from the outside of XXX.so
nm -D XXX.so | grep MY_SYMBOL 
the hidden/local symbols are shown by nm with lowercase symbol type, for example t instead of `T for code-section:
nm XXX.so
00000000000005a7 t HIDDEN_SYMBOL
00000000000005f8 T VISIBLE_SYMBOL
You can also use nm with the option -C to demangle the names (if C++ was used).
Similar to Windows-dlls, one would mark public functions with a define, for example DLL_PUBLIC defined as:
#define DLL_PUBLIC __attribute__ ((visibility (""default"")))

DLL_PUBLIC int my_public_function(){
  ...
}
Which roughly corresponds to Windows'/MSVC-version:
#ifdef BUILDING_DLL
    #define DLL_PUBLIC __declspec(dllexport) 
#else
    #define DLL_PUBLIC __declspec(dllimport) 
#endif
More information about visibility can be found on the gcc wiki.
When a translation unit is compiled with -fvisibility=hidden the resulting symbols have still external linkage (shown with upper case symbol type by nm) and can be used for external linkage without problem if the object files become part of a static libraries. The linkage becomes local only when the object files are linked into a shared library.
To find which symbols in an object file are hidden run:
>>> objdump -t XXXX.o | grep hidden
0000000000000000 g     F .text  000000000000000b .hidden HIDDEN_SYMBOL1
000000000000000b g     F .text  000000000000000b .hidden HIDDEN_SYMBOL2",2018-09-10 08:18:38Z,7
2446,12573816,Community,-1,"Functions or class-methods are defined in source files with the inline specifier.
An example:-
main.cpp
#include ""gum.h""
#include ""foo.h""

int main()
{
    gum();
    foo f;
    f.bar();
    return 0;
}
foo.h (1)
#pragma once

struct foo {
    void bar() const;
};
gum.h (1)
#pragma once

extern void gum();
foo.cpp (1)
#include ""foo.h""
#include <iostream>

inline /* <- wrong! */ void foo::bar() const {
    std::cout << __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ << std::endl;
}
gum.cpp (1)
#include ""gum.h""
#include <iostream>

inline /* <- wrong! */ void gum()
{
    std::cout << __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ << std::endl;
}
If you specify that gum (similarly, foo::bar) is inline at its definition then the compiler will inline gum (if it chooses to), by:-
not emitting any unique definition of gum, and therefore
not emitting any symbol by which the linker can refer to the definition of gum, and instead
replacing all calls to gum with inline copies of the compiled body of gum.
As a result, if you define gum inline in a source file gum.cpp, it is compiled to an object file gum.o in which all calls to gum are inlined and no symbol is defined by which the linker can refer to gum. When you link gum.o into a program together with another object file, e.g. main.o that make references to an external symbol gum, the linker cannot resolve those references. So the linkage fails:
Compile:
g++ -c  main.cpp foo.cpp gum.cpp
Link:
$ g++ -o prog main.o foo.o gum.o
main.o: In function `main':
main.cpp:(.text+0x18): undefined reference to `gum()'
main.cpp:(.text+0x24): undefined reference to `foo::bar() const'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
You can only define gum as inline if the compiler can see its definition in every source file in which gum may be called. That means its inline definition needs to exist in a header file that you include in every source file you compile in which gum may be called. Do one of two things:
Either don't inline the definitions
Remove the inline specifier from the source file definition:
foo.cpp (2)
#include ""foo.h""
#include <iostream>

void foo::bar() const {
    std::cout << __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ << std::endl;
}
gum.cpp (2)
#include ""gum.h""
#include <iostream>

void gum()
{
    std::cout << __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ << std::endl;
}
Rebuild with that:
$ g++ -c  main.cpp foo.cpp gum.cpp
imk@imk-Inspiron-7559:~/develop/so/scrap1$ g++ -o prog main.o foo.o gum.o
imk@imk-Inspiron-7559:~/develop/so/scrap1$ ./prog
void gum()
void foo::bar() const
Success.
Or inline correctly
Inline definitions in header files:
foo.h (2)
#pragma once
#include <iostream>

struct foo {
    void bar() const  { // In-class definition is implicitly inline
        std::cout << __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ << std::endl;
    }
};
// Alternatively...
#if 0
struct foo {
    void bar() const;
};
inline void foo::bar() const  {
    std::cout << __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ << std::endl;
}
#endif
gum.h (2)
#pragma once
#include <iostream>

inline void gum() {
    std::cout << __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ << std::endl;
}
Now we don't need foo.cpp or gum.cpp:
$ g++ -c main.cpp
$ g++ -o prog main.o
$ ./prog
void gum()
void foo::bar() const",2020-06-20 09:12:55Z,6

int (*p1)[10];
In this assignment statement
p1=Arr1;
the pointer is assigned with an expression of the type int * due to the implicit conversion of the array designator to pointer to its first element of the type int *.
The pointer types of the operands are not compatible. So the compiler should issue a message.
You could either write
int (*p1)[10];

//...

p1 = &Arr1;
printf(""1D Array is: \n"");
for(i=0;i<n1;i++)
{
    printf(""Arr[%d] is %d\t"", i, ( *p1 )[i] );
    printf(""\nAddress of %d th array is %p\n"", i,( void * ) ( *p1 + i ) );

2456,74581601,Mike Nakis,773113,"It appears that you have a slight misconception: When a virtual thread is blocked due to synchronization, it is in fact yielding, but the scheduler will not unmount it from the related carrier thread. Instead, the carrier thread will be blocked, yielding. This is one of the current shortcomings of Project Loom, and it is well documented. The team says they might fix it in the future.
Specifically, in Coming to Java 19: Virtual threads and platform threads by Nicolai Parlog 2022-05 we read:
Unfortunately, there’s one more imperfection in the initial virtual thread proposal: When a virtual thread executes a native method or a foreign function or it executes code inside a synchronized block or method, the virtual thread will be pinned to its carrier thread. A pinned thread will not unmount in situations where it otherwise would.
(Emphasis mine.)
Further down in the same article, we read:
[...] a good alternative to synchronization is a ReentrantLock.
Note that I have read the same things in a number of other official sources of information, not just from the above blog post.
This means that at least for now, if you want to avoid blocking the carrier thread, you must refrain from using the synchronized keyword; instead, you must use a ReentrantLock or some other runtime library class that blocks waiting for something to happen while yielding, such as CountdownLatch etc.
So, to answer your question of ""how does a Java virtual thread know when the thread is waiting?"" the answer is that all the classes that provide block waiting while yielding (even the Sleep() method of Thread) have been modified in Java 19 so that they now co-operate with the virtual threads mechanism precisely so as to allow unmounting from the carrier thread.",2022-11-27 13:16:13Z,2

That said, as @IInspectable mentions, you probably need to pass a reference to your exit value instead of the exit value itself, as GetExitCodeProcess requires a pointer to a value:
let mut exit:u32 = 0;
while GetExitCodeProcess(h_process, &mut exit as *mut u32).as_bool(){

String extendFields(String xmlInput, List<String> fields) {
    def xml = new XmlParser().parseText(xmlInput)
    xml.findAll { it.name() == 'DataRow' }.each { row ->
        fields.each { field ->
            if (!row.""$field"") {
                row.appendNode(field)
            }
        }
    }
    new StringWriter().with { out ->
        new XmlNodePrinter(new PrintWriter(out)).with { writer ->

            writer.print(xml)
        }
        out.toString()
    }
}
Calling this with your input XML:
def input = '''<DataTable>
    <DataRow>
        <Field1>1</Field1>
    </DataRow>
    <DataRow>
        <Field1>1</Field1>
        <Field2>1</Field2>
    </DataRow>
    <DataRow>
        <Field1>1</Field1>
        <Field2>1</Field2>
        <Field3>1</Field3>
    </DataRow>
</DataTable>'''

println extendFields(input, ['Field1', 'Field2', 'Field3'])
prints
<DataTable>
  <DataRow>
    <Field1>1</Field1>

    <Field3/>

  </DataRow>
  <DataRow>
    <Field1>1</Field1>
    <Field2>1</Field2>
    <Field3>1</Field3>
  </DataRow>
</DataTable>
So then, you can change your method in the question to call this new method:
Message processData(Message message) {
    def fields = ['Field1', 'Field2', 'Field3']
    def payload = extendFields(message.getBody(Reader), fields)
    message.setBody(payload)
    return message
}
Pulling this out into a separate method also has the advantage of making it more easily testable 😀
Edit
If you want to sort the nodes in the order of the fields you provide, you can add a sort on the children like so:
String extendFields(String xmlInput, List<String> fields) {
    def xml = new XmlParser().parseText(xmlInput)
    xml.findAll { it.name() == 'DataRow' }.each { row ->
        fields.each { field ->
            if (!row.""$field"") {
                row.appendNode(field)
            }
        }
        row.children().sort { fields.indexOf(it.name()) }
    }
    new StringWriter().with { out ->
        new XmlNodePrinter(new PrintWriter(out)).with { writer ->
            writer.preserveWhitespace = true
            writer.print(xml)
        }
        out.toString()
    }
}
Then calling this with the fields in the order we want:
println extendFields(input, ['Field3', 'Field1', 'Field2'])
Prints:
<DataTable>
  <DataRow>
    <Field3/>
    <Field1>1</Field1>

You have to learn to use HTTP to trigger business activity as a side effect of moving documents around the network.
I need to expose specific update actions (not exposed as PATCH, for security reasons), i.e. change the status of an order to ""confirmed"", ""partially confirmed"" or ""refused"".
How would you do this on the Web?
The most common answer would look something like this: you would have a web page for ""the order""; and that page would include hyperlinks to some forms - it might be a simple ""change order status form"", or you might have different forms for each change. When we submit the form, the browser would create from form data and metadata an HTTP POST request, targeting whatever resource was specified by the form.
Important takeaways
It is okay to use POST.
The server can choose whatever URI it likes as the form target.
One convenient choice would be to use the URI for ""the order"" web page, because that allows you to take advantage of the general purpose cache invalidation defined by the HTTP standard.
You can, of course, use PUT or PATCH semantics instead, if you like. The primary difference is that these methods use remote authoring semantics - they are the HTTP methods we would use if we were trying to edit a web page.
To change the status of an order, it might go roughly like this: you would GET the current web page, and edit your local copy to change the status information. Then you would use HTTP to save your copy of the web page on the server:
For PUT, the payload of the request would be the entire web page with your edits.
For PATCH, the payload of the request would be a patch document describing just your edits.
The server would then need to either accept your request (applying your changes to its copy of the web page) or reject them (for example, if those changes are not consistent with business policy).
Which one would be the most consistent and appropriate with the above API design? Do I have other options?
You'll probably have an easier time if you relax the restriction that POST is only used to create resources.
Remember, the world wide web is the reference implementation of the REST architectural style, and it was catastrophically successful. Yet PUT and PATCH were used only rarely -- almost all information was carried to web servers using POST semantics.
But if must limit yourself to these rules for non technical reasons, then you might consider a resource model where information is sent to the business by creating new resources on the web server. In other words, instead of changing the status of the order by editing the order web page, you could instead create a new ""change the status of the order"" document on the server.
(Technically, you could use any of POST/PUT/PATCH to create the new document, but POST is normal and consistent with your constraints, so it seems a reasonable starting point).",2022-11-26 13:15:23Z,0

That error is caused by the fact that when you create a plot with MatplotlibBackend and show=False, the figure is not created (too long to explain why); this behavior is specific to MatplotlibBackend, the other backends should not be affected by it. So, p1.fig is None.
However, the plotting function exposes the save method, which is nothing more than a wrapper to a specific plotting library ""save"" functionality. If you look at the source code, you'll see that MatplotlibBackend.save calls matplotlib's savefig, but first it checks if the figure has been created. If not, it forces the creation.
So, all you have to do is:
p1.save(f, format = ""svg"")
One final note. If possible, do not use attributes or methods starting with _ (underscore). They represent private attributes and the names might change from version to version. If you really need to retrieve the matplotlib figure, use p1.fig.
EDIT to answer the question in the comment about performance:
For back-compatibility reasons, the new module uses an adaptive algorithm for line plots by default, which is different from the one used on SymPy. On the one hand it can be easily applied to a wider set of applications, on the other hand it is slower.
You have two options: either way you might want to change the configuration file of the module.
Option 1: the adaptive algorithm minimizes some loss function (loss_fn) and stops when a threshold (adaptive_goal) has been reached. We can increase this threshold (which by default is set to 0.01), thus improving performance but sacrificing the smooth quality of lines.
from spb.defaults import cfg, set_defaults

# it requires a few tries to find an appropriate value
cfg[""adaptive""][""goal""] = 0.02
set_defaults(cfg)

# restart the kernel to load the new configuration
Option 2: don't use the adaptive algorithm and switch to the uniform meshing algorithm which uses Numpy and vectorization (usually done with adaptive=False and possibly setting an appropriate number of discretization points n=something)! This is very very fast in comparison to the adaptive algorithm.
Think about it: generally, our plots are relatively small in comparison to the screen size. 1000 points per line (or whatever number you decide to use) should create smooth-enough lines.
So, you can deactivate the adaptive algorithm on a plot-by-plot basis (with adaptive=False), or you can set the module to always use the uniform meshing algorithm (this is the setup that I use on my machine).
from spb.defaults import cfg, set_defaults

# disable adaptive algorithm
cfg[""adaptive""][""used_by_default""] = False
set_defaults(cfg)

# restart the kernel to load the new configuration
Then, when you create a plot and you feel like it should be smoother, simply increase the number of discretization points by setting n=something (default value is 1000).

  select id, email
    from test;

---------------------- -------------------- 
1                      aaa                  
2                      bbb                  
3                      ccc                  
4                      bbb                  
5                      ddd                  
6                      eee                  
7                      aaa                  
8                      aaa                  
9                      eee 
So, we need to find all repeated emails and delete all of them, but the latest id.
In this case, aaa, bbb and eee are repeated, so we want to delete IDs 1, 7, 2 and 6.
To accomplish this, first we need to find all the repeated emails:
      select email 
        from test
       group by email
      having count(*) > 1;

EMAIL                
-------------------- 
aaa                  
bbb                  
eee  
Then, from this dataset, we need to find the latest id for each one of these repeated emails:
  select max(id) as lastId, email
    from test
   where email in (
              select email 
                from test
               group by email
              having count(*) > 1
       )
   group by email;

LASTID                 EMAIL                
---------------------- -------------------- 
8                      aaa                  
4                      bbb                  
9                      eee                                 
Finally we can now delete all of these emails with an Id smaller than LASTID. So the solution is:
delete test
  from test
 inner join (
  select max(id) as lastId, email
    from test
   where email in (
              select email 
                from test
               group by email
              having count(*) > 1
       )
   group by email
) duplic on duplic.email = test.email
 where test.id < duplic.lastId;
I don't have mySql installed on this machine right now, but should work
Update
The above delete works, but I found a more optimized version:
 delete test
   from test
  inner join (
     select max(id) as lastId, email
       from test
      group by email
     having count(*) > 1) duplic on duplic.email = test.email
  where test.id < duplic.lastId;
You can see that it deletes the oldest duplicates, i.e. 1, 7, 2, 6:
select * from test;
+----+-------+
| id | email |
+----+-------+
|  3 | ccc   |
|  4 | bbb   |
|  5 | ddd   |
|  8 | aaa   |
|  9 | eee   |

let number_list = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];
does not modify the original number_list variable. It creates a new one and names it identically, shadowing the original name.
In simpler terms that means that now two number_list variables exist, but the first one is no longer accessible because the second one has taken over the name. The largest_nbr variable, however, references the first one.
Note that what you are trying here is impossible, because you cannot modify the array while you borrow parts of it. I guess this is why you added a let to it, because if you would simply write number_list = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8], without the let, you would get an error that tells you that you can't modify it while it is borrowed in largest_nbr.

2604,74581365,Thomas Mueller,19840875,"I assume you're referring to this sentence from Manifest - Web Accessible Resources:
""Content scripts themselves do not need to be allowed.""
That means you don't need to declare content-script.js as a web-accessible resource in order to inject content-script.js into a web page.
But example.txt is not a content script. It's just a file that's part of your extension. Because content-script.js runs in the context of a web page, content-script.js can only fetch() example.txt if you declare example.txt as a web-accessible resource.
If you don't want to declare example.txt as a web-accessible resource, you can have content-script.js send a message to the extension's service worker. The service worker can then fetch() example.txt and send the result back to content-script.js.
Another problem:
fetch() returns a Promise, and so does r.text()
let txt = fetch(chrome.runtime.getURL('example.txt')).then(r=>r.text());
This code doesn't put the contents of example.txt into the variable txt.
Instead, the variable txt contains a Promise that evaluates to the contents of example.txt.
You either need to chain another then-handler to your code, or use async/await. See await Error at Top Level Module in Chrome Extension Service_worker

2640,74581303,Adam Arthur,20605869,"Let's assume we have a MongoDB collection that looks like this:
{ ""first_name"":""Sally"", ""last_name"":""McDaniels"", ""email"":""sally.mcdaniels@emails.com"", ""username"":""sassysally"" }
There are several scenarios possible. First, do the fields exist in the collection? In other words, it seems to me we need to check for two conditions:
That an expected field is actually in the document AND
That the fields contains a string with a length > 0
My approach to situations like this is to first write the Mongo Query and test it in the console, and then write the Javascript. Let's start by creating some sample data.
use test-db
db.profiles.insert({
   ""first_name"":""Sally"",
   ""last_name"":""McDaniels"",
   ""email"":""sally.mcdaniels@emails.com"",
   ""username"":""sassysally""
 });

db.profiles.insert({
   ""first_name"":"""",
   ""last_name"":"""",
   ""email"":"""",
   ""username"":""anonymous-12345""
 });

db.profiles.insert({
   ""first_name"":""John"",
   ""email"":"""",
   ""username"":""anonymous-678910""
 });

db.profiles.find({})
This inserts sample records that we can use to test our query against.
First, I need a generic query that will select all records that either have the fields = """" or that do not exist in the record.
db.profiles.find(
  { 
     $or:
       [ 
         { last_name: { $eq: """" } }, 
         { last_name: { $exists: false } } 
       ]
   })
This query will return ALL records where last_name is either """" or does not exist in the database. We repeat this pattern for all fields we want to check.
Finally, we need to constrain the query against a specific user and test against all fields we want confirmed to exist and be non-zero. In this example I'll constrain it by the _id, but you could do it with whatever unique identifier you have for the logged in user.
db.profiles.find({ $and : [
    {""_id"" : ObjectId(""6381f2c234f9141e153df6f7"")},
    { $or:
       [ 
         { first_name: { $eq: """" } }, 
         { first_name: { $exists: false } },
         { last_name: { $eq: """" } }, 
         { last_name: { $exists: false } },
         { email: { $eq: """" } }, 
         { email: { $exists: false } },
         { username: { $eq: """" } }, 
         { username: { $exists: false } },
       ] },
  ]
});
If the query returns a record -- then you know that the profile is incomplete. Now that you have the Mongo Query, in Node.js I would make a function like this:
    async function checkProfileComplete(_id) {
        var query =  
        { 
         $and : 
         [
          {""_id"" : mongoose.Types.ObjectId(_id),
           { $or:
            [ 
             { first_name: { $eq: """" } }, 
             { first_name: { $exists: false } },
             { last_name: { $eq: """" } }, 
             { last_name: { $exists: false } },
             { email: { $eq: """" } }, 
             { email: { $exists: false } },
             { username: { $eq: """" } }, 
             { username: { $exists: false } },
            ]
           },
         ]
        };

        // Query the database and put the result into an array
        var profileCompleteAr = await mongoose.connection.db
          .collection(""profiles"")
          .find(query).toArray();  

        // Check if the array has anything in it.  If it does,
        // it means the profile has missing or incomplete fields.
        if(profileCompleteAr.length > 0){
          return false;
        } else {
          return true;
        }
    }

Databases are not able to efficiently use a single compound index to process a query with an OR.

Since the operator is a $or rather than a $and the database cannot combine both of the bounds at the same time since it would miss results.
Edit Also worth mentioning that questions like this are best understood by gathering and looking at explain output.

InfluxDB line protocol
Graphite protocol
DataDog protocol
OpenTSDB protocol
Prometheus text exposition and Pushgateway protocol
JSON line protocol
CSV protocol
You can check whether the data is successfully ingested by querying it via export API - see these docs.
VictoriaMetrics returns ""success"" response when some ingested lines contain improperly formatted data, since other lines may contain correct data, so they are successfully ingested into VictoriaMetrics.

getElementsByClassName (without ""."")
const buttons = document.getElementsByClassName('bttn');
querySelectorAll (with ""."")
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('.bttn');
And for changing the style of an element, you can use .style property on that element:
element.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
So this code will help you:
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('.bttn');

2676,74581241,Cpt.Hook,20599896,"Short Answer: You are overwriting the previously defined value of value in line 61.
Longer answer: Consider this minimized example:
value = True
dictionary = {'foo': 'bar', 'baz': 'qwurx'}
for key, value in dictionary.items():
    print(key, value)
print(value, type(value))
Output:
# foo bar
# baz qwurx
# qwurx <class 'str'>
The issue is that you re-defined value in the loop on every call. The value-variable shadows and overwrites the outer one.
To find such things on your own next time: The error message is already a good hint. It tells you that the method expects a boolean value, but got a string instead. Now go back from the given line to find where the variable is set last...

You should write:
    free(dataset[0]);  // free the first point
    memmove(&dataset[0], &dataset[1], (CHUNK - 1) * sizeof(*dataset));
    dataset[CHUNK - 1] = NULL;  // clear the pointer to avoid duplicate pointers
There is no need to reallocate the array, especially if you read one more point at the end (into dataset[CHUNK - 1]). If you are meant to reallocate the array, you should not consider reallocation failure an error:
    double **new_dataset = realloc(dataset, (CHUNK - 1) * sizeof(*dataset));
    if (new_dataset != NULL) {
        // realloc succeeded, use the new pointer

    } else {
        // realloc failed: the block was not reallocated and is still valid
        // keep using the original pointer
    }
Also be aware that after the shift there are only CHUNK - 1 points available so the printing code must stop at CHUNK - 1. Using a variable for the number of points seems a better approach.
Note that just like realloc, memmove and memcpy are confusing and error prone, even for savvy programmers I must admit, I recommend writing a loop instead, that will potentially outperform the memmove call:
    free(dataset[0]);  // free the first point
    for (int i = 0; i < CHUNK - 1; i++) {
        dataset[i] = dataset[i + 1];
    }

2755,18093928,Stephen C,139985,"The java <class-name> command syntax
First of all, you need to understand the correct way to launch a program using the java (or javaw) command.
The normal syntax1 is this:
    java [ <options> ] <class-name> [<arg> ...]
where <option> is a command line option (starting with a ""-"" character), <class-name> is a fully qualified Java class name, and <arg> is an arbitrary command line argument that gets passed to your application.
1 - There are some other syntaxes which are described near the end of this answer.
The fully qualified name (FQN) for the class is conventionally written as you would in Java source code; e.g.
    packagename.packagename2.packagename3.ClassName
However some versions of the java command allow you to use slashes instead of periods; e.g.
    packagename/packagename2/packagename3/ClassName
which (confusingly) looks like a file pathname, but isn't one. Note that the term fully qualified name is standard Java terminology ... not something I just made up to confuse you :-)
Here is an example of what a java command should look like:
    java -Xmx100m com.acme.example.ListUsers fred joe bert
The above is going to cause the java command to do the following:
Search for the compiled version of the com.acme.example.ListUsers class.
Load the class.
Check that the class has a main method with signature, return type and modifiers given by public static void main(String[]). (Note, the method argument's name is NOT part of the signature.)
Call that method passing it the command line arguments (""fred"", ""joe"", ""bert"") as a String[].
Reasons why Java cannot find the class
When you get the message ""Could not find or load main class ..."", that means that the first step has failed. The java command was not able to find the class. And indeed, the ""..."" in the message will be the fully qualified class name that java is looking for.
So why might it be unable to find the class?
Reason #1 - you made a mistake with the classname argument
The first likely cause is that you may have provided the wrong class name. (Or ... the right class name, but in the wrong form.) Considering the example above, here are a variety of wrong ways to specify the class name:
Example #1 - a simple class name:
java ListUser
When the class is declared in a package such as com.acme.example, then you must use the full classname including the package name in the java command; e.g.
java com.acme.example.ListUser
Example #2 - a filename or pathname rather than a class name:
java ListUser.class
java com/acme/example/ListUser.class
Example #3 - a class name with the casing incorrect:
java com.acme.example.listuser
Example #4 - a typo
java com.acme.example.mistuser
Example #5 - a source filename (except for Java 11 or later; see below)
java ListUser.java
Example #6 - you forgot the class name entirely
java lots of arguments
Reason #2 - the application's classpath is incorrectly specified
The second likely cause is that the class name is correct, but that the java command cannot find the class. To understand this, you need to understand the concept of the ""classpath"". This is explained well by the Oracle documentation:
The java command documentation
Setting the Classpath.
The Java Tutorial - PATH and CLASSPATH
So ... if you have specified the class name correctly, the next thing to check is that you have specified the classpath correctly:
Read the three documents linked above. (Yes ... READ them! It is important that a Java programmer understands at least the basics of how the Java classpath mechanisms works.)
Look at command line and / or the CLASSPATH environment variable that is in effect when you run the java command. Check that the directory names and JAR file names are correct.
If there are relative pathnames in the classpath, check that they resolve correctly ... from the current directory that is in effect when you run the java command.
Check that the class (mentioned in the error message) can be located on the effective classpath.
Note that the classpath syntax is different for Windows versus Linux and Mac OS. (The classpath separator is ; on Windows and : on the others. If you use the wrong separator for your platform, you won't get an explicit error message. Instead, you will get a nonexistent file or directory on the path that will be silently ignored.)
Reason #2a - the wrong directory is on the classpath
When you put a directory on the classpath, it notionally corresponds to the root of the qualified name space. Classes are located in the directory structure beneath that root, by mapping the fully qualified name to a pathname. So for example, if ""/usr/local/acme/classes"" is on the class path, then when the JVM looks for a class called com.acme.example.Foon, it will look for a "".class"" file with this pathname:
  /usr/local/acme/classes/com/acme/example/Foon.class
If you had put ""/usr/local/acme/classes/com/acme/example"" on the classpath, then the JVM wouldn't be able to find the class.
Reason #2b - the subdirectory path doesn't match the FQN
If your classes FQN is com.acme.example.Foon, then the JVM is going to look for ""Foon.class"" in the directory ""com/acme/example"":
If your directory structure doesn't match the package naming as per the pattern above, the JVM won't find your class.
If you attempt rename a class by moving it, that will fail as well ... but the exception stacktrace will be different. It is liable to say something like this:
Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: <path> (wrong name: <name>)
because the FQN in the class file doesn't match what the class loader is expecting to find.
To give a concrete example, supposing that:
you want to run com.acme.example.Foon class,
the full file path is /usr/local/acme/classes/com/acme/example/Foon.class,
your current working directory is /usr/local/acme/classes/com/acme/example/,
then:
# wrong, FQN is needed
java Foon

# wrong, there is no `com/acme/example` folder in the current working directory
java com.acme.example.Foon

# wrong, similar to above
java -classpath . com.acme.example.Foon

# fine; relative classpath set
java -classpath ../../.. com.acme.example.Foon

# fine; absolute classpath set
java -classpath /usr/local/acme/classes com.acme.example.Foon
Notes:
The -classpath option can be shortened to -cp in most Java releases. Check the respective manual entries for java, javac and so on.
Think carefully when choosing between absolute and relative pathnames in classpaths. Remember that a relative pathname may ""break"" if the current directory changes.
Reason #2c - dependencies missing from the classpath
The classpath needs to include all of the other (non-system) classes that your application depends on. (The system classes are located automatically, and you rarely need to concern yourself with this.) For the main class to load correctly, the JVM needs to find:
the class itself.
all classes and interfaces in the superclass hierarchy (e.g. see Java class is present in classpath but startup fails with Error: Could not find or load main class)
all classes and interfaces that are referred to by means of variable or variable declarations, or method call or field access expressions.
(Note: the JLS and JVM specifications allow some scope for a JVM to load classes ""lazily"", and this can affect when a classloader exception is thrown.)
Reason #3 - the class has been declared in the wrong package
It occasionally happens that someone puts a source code file into the the wrong folder in their source code tree, or they leave out the package declaration. If you do this in an IDE, the IDE's compiler will tell you about this immediately. Similarly if you use a decent Java build tool, the tool will run javac in a way that will detect the problem. However, if you build your Java code by hand, you can do it in such a way that the compiler doesn't notice the problem, and the resulting "".class"" file is not in the place that you expect it to be.
Still can't find the problem?
There lots of things to check, and it is easy to miss something. Try adding the -Xdiag option to the java command line (as the first thing after java). It will output various things about class loading, and this may offer you clues as to what the real problem is.
Also, consider possible problems caused by copying and pasting invisible or non-ASCII characters from websites, documents and so on. And consider ""homoglyphs"", where two letters or symbols look the same ... but aren't.
You may run into this problem if you have invalid or incorrect signatures in META-INF/*.SF. You can try opening up the .jar in your favorite ZIP editor, and removing files from META-INF until all you have is your MANIFEST.MF. However this is NOT RECOMMENDED in general. (The invalid signature may be the result of someone having injected malware into the original signed JAR file. If you erase the invalid signature, you are in infecting your application with the malware!) The recommended approach is to get hold of JAR files with valid signatures, or rebuild them from the (authentic) original source code.
Finally, you can apparently run into this problem if there is a syntax error in the MANIFEST.MF file (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/67145190/139985).
Alternative syntaxes for java
There are three alternative syntaxes for the launching Java programs using the java command.
The syntax used for launching an ""executable"" JAR file is as follows:
java [ <options> ] -jar <jar-file-name> [<arg> ...]
e.g.
java -Xmx100m -jar /usr/local/acme-example/listuser.jar fred
The name of the entry-point class (i.e. com.acme.example.ListUser) and the classpath are specified in the MANIFEST of the JAR file.
The syntax for launching an application from a module (Java 9 and later) is as follows:
java [ <options> ] --module <module>[/<mainclass>] [<arg> ...]
The name of the entrypoint class is either defined by the <module> itself, or is given by the optional <mainclass>.
From Java 11 onwards, you can use the java command to compile and run a single source code file using the following syntax:
java [ <options> ] <sourcefile> [<arg> ...]
where <sourcefile> is (typically) a file with the suffix "".java"".
For more details, please refer to the official documentation for the java command for the Java release that you are using.
IDEs
A typical Java IDE has support for running Java applications in the IDE JVM itself or in a child JVM. These are generally immune from this particular exception, because the IDE uses its own mechanisms to construct the runtime classpath, identify the main class and create the java command line.
However it is still possible for this exception to occur, if you do things behind the back of the IDE. For example, if you have previously set up an Application Launcher for your Java app in Eclipse, and you then moved the JAR file containing the ""main"" class to a different place in the file system without telling Eclipse, Eclipse would unwittingly launch the JVM with an incorrect classpath.
In short, if you get this problem in an IDE, check for things like stale IDE state, broken project references or broken launcher configurations.
It is also possible for an IDE to simply get confused. IDE's are hugely complicated pieces of software comprising many interacting parts. Many of these parts adopt various caching strategies in order to make the IDE as a whole responsive. These can sometimes go wrong, and one possible symptom is problems when launching applications. If you suspect this could be happening, it is worth trying other things like restarting your IDE, rebuilding the project and so on.

The Main class could not be found
The Main class could not be loaded (this case is not fully discussed in the accepted answer)
The Main class could not be found when there is a typo or wrong syntax in the fully qualified class name or it does not exist in the provided classpath.
The Main class could not be loaded when the class cannot be initiated. Typically the main class extends another class and that class does not exist in the provided classpath.

This happens if the class file with PSVM could not be loaded. One possible reason for that is that the class may be implementing an interface or extending another class that is not on the classpath.

In the first case, the compiler knows something is a number and also 5. In the second case, you told the compiler it is number, so the compiler throws away the information about 5.
Your annotations of createSlice do the same - TS could infere most types from usage, but your manual annotations remove all that extra info and so TypeScript goes back to generic things that do not have details about payload etc.

The lambda uses it_start and then without any synchronization you immediately modify it in the main thread. Capture it_start and it_end by-copy. Also std::ref is pointless there. You are not passing a reference to the std::thread constructor, but just to a normal direct function call. Also, as I mentioned in the comments, template arguments in a function call can be deduced:
threads.push_back(std::thread([it_start,it_end,&results](){

threads.push_back( std::thread{ sum_of_digits<T,typename T::const_iterator>, it_start, it_end, std::ref(results[i]) });

There are some smaller issues in the code, e.g. pointless reserve after resizing/construction of vectors or

2818,7165395,Chris Baker,610573,"This is, in essence, what AJAX is for. Your page loads, and you add an event to an element. When the user causes the event to be triggered, say by clicking something, your Javascript uses the XMLHttpRequest object to send a request to a server.
After the server responds (presumably with output), another Javascript function/event gives you a place to work with that output, including simply sticking it into the page like any other piece of HTML.
You can do it ""by hand"" with plain Javascript , or you can use jQuery. Depending on the size of your project and particular situation, it may be more simple to just use plain Javascript .
Plain Javascript
In this very basic example, we send a request to myAjax.php when the user clicks a link. The server will generate some content, in this case ""hello world!"". We will put into the HTML element with the id output.
The javascript
// handles the click event for link 1, sends the query
function getOutput() {
  getRequest(
      'myAjax.php', // URL for the PHP file
       drawOutput,  // handle successful request
       drawError    // handle error
  );
  return false;
}  
// handles drawing an error message
function drawError() {
    var container = document.getElementById('output');
    container.innerHTML = 'Bummer: there was an error!';
}
// handles the response, adds the html
function drawOutput(responseText) {
    var container = document.getElementById('output');
    container.innerHTML = responseText;
}
// helper function for cross-browser request object
function getRequest(url, success, error) {
    var req = false;
    try{
        // most browsers
        req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    } catch (e){
        // IE
        try{
            req = new ActiveXObject(""Msxml2.XMLHTTP"");
        } catch(e) {
            // try an older version
            try{
                req = new ActiveXObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP"");
            } catch(e) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    if (!req) return false;
    if (typeof success != 'function') success = function () {};
    if (typeof error!= 'function') error = function () {};
    req.onreadystatechange = function(){
        if(req.readyState == 4) {
            return req.status === 200 ? 
                success(req.responseText) : error(req.status);

With a javascript library (jQuery et al)
Arguably, that is a lot of Javascript code. You can shorten that up by tightening the blocks or using more terse logic operators, of course, but there's still a lot going on there. If you plan on doing a lot of this type of thing on your project, you might be better off with a javascript library.
Using the same HTML and PHP from above, this is your entire script (with jQuery included on the page). I've tightened up the code a little to be more consistent with jQuery's general style, but you get the idea:
// handles the click event, sends the query
function getOutput() {
   $.ajax({
      url:'myAjax.php',
      complete: function (response) {
          $('#output').html(response.responseText);
      },
      error: function () {
          $('#output').html('Bummer: there was an error!');
      }
  });
  return false;
}
Try it out: http://jsfiddle.net/GRMule/WQXXT/
Don't rush out for jQuery just yet: adding any library is still adding hundreds or thousands of lines of code to your project just as surely as if you had written them. Inside the jQuery library file, you'll find similar code to that in the first example, plus a whole lot more. That may be a good thing, it may not. Plan, and consider your project's current size and future possibility for expansion and the target environment or platform.
If this is all you need to do, write the plain javascript once and you're done.

echo ""You have executed the PHP function 'after loading o refreshing the page<br>"";

echo ""2. I have changed 'Old content' to '"";
echo exec('echo $(cat texto.txt)');echo "".<br><br>"";
echo ""Proofs 1 and 2 say that if you want to make a new request to the server, you can do: 1. reload the page, 2. refresh the page, 3. make a call through an HTML form and PHP code, or 4. do a call through Ajax.<br><br>"";

Note: The texto.txt file has the content 'Hello world! (Old content).
The 'fact' is that whenever I click the 'CallPhp' button I get the message 'Hello world!' printed on my page. Therefore, a server-side script is not always required to execute a PHP function via Javascript.
But the execution of the bash commands only happens while the page is loading or refreshing, never because of that kind of Javascript apparent-call raised before. Once the page is loaded, the execution of bash scripts requires a true-call (PHP, Ajax) to a server-side PHP resource.
So, If you don't want the user to know what commands are running on the server:
You 'should' use the execution of the commands indirectly through a PHP script on the server-side (PHP-form, or Ajax on the client-side).
Otherwise:
If the output of commands on the server-side is not delayed:
You 'can' use the execution of the commands directly from the page (less 'cognitive' resources—less PHP and more Bash—and less code, less time, usually easier, and more comfortable if you know the bash language).

yq -o xml -p xml '

' sourcefile.xml > outputfile.xml
Using kislyuk/yq:
To manipulate XML files, yq provides xq, which converts the XML file into JSON, then uses stedolan/jq for manipulation. The -x option converts the output back to XML:
xq -x '
  .products.product[] |= (.Title += "" "" + .Dimensions + "" "" + .Size)
' sourcefile.xml > outputfile.xml
Output
For both, the outputfile.xml should then look like:
<products>
  <product>
    <id>01</id>
    <Title>Product 1 Title S for Adult</Title>
    <Dimensions>S</Dimensions>

    <Title>Product 2 Title Medium for Kids</Title>
    <Dimensions>Medium</Dimensions>
    <Size>for Kids</Size>
  </product>
</products>
Using xmlstarlet
Here you can go with:
xmlstarlet ed -u /products/product/Title -x '
  concat(../Title, ../Dimensions, ../Size)
' sourcefile.xml > outputfile.xml
Then, the outputfile.xml would then look like:
<?xml version=""1.0""?>
<products>
  <product>
    <id>01</id>
    <Title> Product 1 Title  S  for Adult </Title>
    <Dimensions><![CDATA[ S ]]></Dimensions>

    <Title> Product 2 Title  Medium  for Kids </Title>
    <Dimensions><![CDATA[ Medium ]]></Dimensions>
    <Size><![CDATA[ for Kids ]]></Size>
  </product>
</products>
Note: The important thing (for all three approaches) is to traverse to each product, and collect the items for concatenation from their children only. With both yq implementations, this is achieved using the update operator |=. For xmlstarlet you need to move with relative XPaths using .. to go up one level.

This essentially throws away information about any more specific type that the compiler may have inferred*. The type of x will be widened to T:
const badMapper1: Record<string, Type1> = { foo1: bar1, foo2: bar2 };
const badMapper2 = { foo3: bar3, foo4: bar4 } as Record<string, Type2>;    

export type BadMapperKeys = keyof typeof badMapper1 | keyof typeof badMapper2;
// type BadMapperKeys = string
Instead, you're looking for something like ""the satisfies operator"" as requested in microsoft/TypeScript#7481 and which will be introduced in TypeScript 4.9. The idea is that an expression like x satisfies T would verify that x is assignable to type T without widening it to T. With that operator you could say something like
const mapper1 = { foo1: bar1, foo2: bar2 } satisfies { [key: string]: Type1 }
const mapper2 = { foo3: bar3, foo4: bar4 } satisfies { [key: string]: Type2 }

export type MapperKeys = keyof typeof mapper1 | keyof typeof mapper2;
// type MapperKeys = ""foo1"" | ""foo2"" | ""foo3"" | ""foo4""
and be done.
For versions of TypeScript before 4.9 you can write helper functions to behave similarly. The general form is something like this:
const satisfies = <T,>() => <U extends T>(u: U) => u;
And then instead of x satisfies T you write (the more cumbersome) satisfies<T>()(x). This works because satisfies<T>() produces an identity function of the form <U extends T>(u: U)=>u where the type of the input U is constrained to T, and the return type is the narrower type U and not the wider type T.
Let's try it:
const mapper1 = satisfies<Record<string, Type1>>()({ foo1: bar1, foo2: bar2 });
const mapper2 = satisfies<Record<string, Type2>>()({ foo3: bar3, foo4: bar4 });
export type MapperKeys = keyof typeof mapper1 | keyof typeof mapper2;
// type MapperKeys = ""foo1"" | ""foo2"" | ""foo3"" | ""foo4""
Looks good!
In your case you specifically asked to specify the object value type but not the keys. If you want you can adapt the satisfies function so that you specify the property value type T and let the compiler infer just the keys. Something like this:
const satisfiesRecord = <T,>() => <K extends PropertyKey>(rec: Record<K, T>) => rec;
You can see that it behaves similarly:
const mapper1 = satisfiesRecord<Type1>()({ foo1: bar1, foo2: bar2, });
const mapper2 = satisfiesRecord<Type2>()({ foo3: bar3, foo4: bar4, });
export type MapperKeys = keyof typeof mapper1 | keyof typeof mapper2;
// type MapperKeys = ""foo1"" | ""foo2"" | ""foo3"" | ""foo4""

            if self._dataset_kind == _DatasetKind.Iterable:

Both setups are equivalent. We pass a generator to DataLoader and do not specify the sampler. DataLoader automatically creates a RandomSampler object with the generator and assign the same generator to self.generator.
Scenario I

We start by summarising the two behaviour of the two logical operators and and or. These idioms will form the basis of our discussion below.
and
Return the first Falsy value if there are any, else return the last value in the expression.
or
Return the first Truthy value if there are any, else return the last value in the expression.
The behaviour is also summarised in the docs, especially in this table:
Operation Result

not x if x is false, then True, else False
The only operator returning a boolean value regardless of its operands is the not operator.
""Truthiness"", and ""Truthy"" Evaluations
The statement
len(args) and max(args) - min(args)
Is a very pythonic concise (and arguably less readable) way of saying ""if args is not empty, return the result of max(args) - min(args)"", otherwise return 0. In general, it is a more concise representation of an if-else expression. For example,
exp1 and exp2
Should (roughly) translate to:
r1 = exp1
if r1:
    r1 = exp2
Or, equivalently,
r1 = exp2 if exp1 else exp1
Similarly,
exp1 or exp2
Should (roughly) translate to:
r1 = exp1
if not r1:
    r1 = exp2
Or, equivalently,
r1 = exp1 if exp1 else exp2
Where exp1 and exp2 are arbitrary python objects, or expressions that return some object. The key to understanding the uses of the logical and and or operators here is understanding that they are not restricted to operating on, or returning boolean values. Any object with a truthiness value can be tested here. This includes int, str, list, dict, tuple, set, NoneType, and user defined objects. Short circuiting rules still apply as well.
But what is truthiness?
It refers to how objects are evaluated when used in conditional expressions. @Patrick Haugh summarises truthiness nicely in this post.
All values are considered ""truthy"" except for the following, which are ""falsy"":
None
False
0
0.0
0j
Decimal(0)
Fraction(0, 1)
[] - an empty list
{} - an empty dict
() - an empty tuple
'' - an empty str
b'' - an empty bytes
set() - an empty set
an empty range, like range(0)
objects for which
obj.__bool__() returns False
obj.__len__() returns 0
A ""truthy"" value will satisfy the check performed by if or while statements. We use ""truthy"" and ""falsy"" to differentiate from the bool values True and False.
How and Works
We build on OP's question as a segue into a discussion on how these operators in these instances.
Given a function with the definition
def foo(*args):
    ...
How do I return the difference between the minimum and maximum value in a list of zero or more arguments?
Finding the minimum and maximum is easy (use the inbuilt functions!). The only snag here is appropriately handling the corner case where the argument list could be empty (for example, calling foo()). We can do both in a single line thanks to the and operator:
def foo(*args):
     return len(args) and max(args) - min(args)
foo(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# 4

foo()
# 0
Since and is used, the second expression must also be evaluated if the first is True. Note that, if the first expression is evaluated to be truthy, the return value is always the result of the second expression. If the first expression is evaluated to be Falsy, then the result returned is the result of the first expression.
In the function above, If foo receives one or more arguments, len(args) is greater than 0 (a positive number), so the result returned is max(args) - min(args). OTOH, if no arguments are passed, len(args) is 0 which is Falsy, and 0 is returned.
Note that an alternative way to write this function would be:
def foo(*args):
    if not len(args):
        return 0
    
    return max(args) - min(args)
Or, more concisely,
def foo(*args):
    return 0 if not args else max(args) - min(args)
If course, none of these functions perform any type checking, so unless you completely trust the input provided, do not rely on the simplicity of these constructs.
How or Works
I explain the working of or in a similar fashion with a contrived example.
Given a function with the definition
def foo(*args):
    ...
How would you complete foo to return all numbers over 9000?
We use or to handle the corner case here. We define foo as:
def foo(*args):
     return [x for x in args if x > 9000] or 'No number over 9000!'

foo(9004, 1, 2, 500)
# [9004]

foo(1, 2, 3, 4)
# 'No number over 9000!'
foo performs a filtration on the list to retain all numbers over 9000. If there exist any such numbers, the result of the list comprehension is a non-empty list which is Truthy, so it is returned (short circuiting in action here). If there exist no such numbers, then the result of the list comp is [] which is Falsy. So the second expression is now evaluated (a non-empty string) and is returned.
Using conditionals, we could re-write this function as,
def foo(*args):
    r = [x for x in args if x > 9000]
    if not r:
        return 'No number over 9000!' 
    
    return r
As before, this structure is more flexible in terms of error handling.",2022-07-29 08:13:42Z,187
2885,47007680,Amit Joki,3001736,"Quoting from Python Docs
Note that neither and nor or restrict the value and type they return to False and True, but rather return the last evaluated argument. This is sometimes useful, e.g., if s is a string that should be replaced by a default value if it is empty, the expression s or 'foo' yields the desired value.
So, this is how Python was designed to evaluate the boolean expressions and the above documentation gives us an insight of why they did it so.
To get a boolean value just typecast it.
return bool(len(args) and max(args)-min(args))
Why?
Short-circuiting.
For example:
2 and 3 # Returns 3 because 2 is Truthy so it has to check 3 too
0 and 3 # Returns 0 because 0 is Falsey and there's no need to check 3 at all
The same goes for or too, that is, it will return the expression which is Truthy as soon as it finds it, cause evaluating the rest of the expression is redundant.
Instead of returning hardcore True or False, Python returns Truthy or Falsey, which are anyway going to evaluate to True or False. You could use the expression as is, and it will still work.
To know what's Truthy and Falsey, check Patrick Haugh's answer",2017-10-30 05:41:43Z,21
2886,47007680,Nithin Varghese,5209865,"and and or perform boolean logic, but they return one of the actual values when they are comparing. When using and, values are evaluated in a boolean context from left to right. 0, '', [], (), {}, and None are false in a boolean context; everything else is true.
If all values are true in a boolean context, and returns the last value.
>>> 2 and 5
5
>>> 2 and 5 and 10
10
If any value is false in a boolean context and returns the first false value.
>>> '' and 5
''
>>> 2 and 0 and 5
0
So the code
return len(args) and max(args)-min(args)
returns the value of max(args)-min(args) when there is args else it returns len(args) which is 0.",2017-10-30 03:55:20Z,8
2887,47007680,salparadise,62138,"Is this legit/reliable style, or are there any gotchas on this?
This is legit, it is a short circuit evaluation where the last value is returned.
You provide a good example. The function will return 0 if no arguments are passed, and the code doesn't have to check for a special case of no arguments passed.
Another way to use this, is to default None arguments to a mutable primitive, like an empty list:
def fn(alist=None):
    alist = alist or []
    ....
If some non-truthy value is passed to alist it defaults to an empty list, handy way to avoid an if statement and the mutable default argument pitfall",2017-10-30 03:26:57Z,5
2888,47007680,Eric Duminil,6419007,"Gotchas
Yes, there are a few gotchas.
fn() == fn(3) == fn(4, 4)
First, if fn returns 0, you cannot know if it was called without any parameter, with one parameter or with multiple, equal parameters :
>>> fn()
0
>>> fn(3)
0
>>> fn(3, 3, 3)
0
What does fn mean?
Then, Python is a dynamic language. It's not specified anywhere what fn does, what its input should be and what its output should look like. Therefore, it's really important to name the function correctly. Similarly, arguments don't have to be called args. delta(*numbers) or calculate_range(*numbers) might describe better what the function is supposed to do.
Argument errors
Finally, the logical and operator is supposed to prevent the function to fail if called without any argument. It still fails if some argument isn't a number, though:
>>> fn('1')

Possible alternative
Here's a way to write the function according to the ""Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission."" principle:
def delta(*numbers):
    try:
        return max(numbers) - min(numbers)
    except TypeError:
        raise ValueError(""delta should only be called with numerical arguments"") from None
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError(""delta should be called with at least one numerical argument"") from None
As an example:
>>> delta()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
  File ""<stdin>"", line 7, in delta
ValueError: delta should be called with at least one numerical argument
>>> delta(3)
0
>>> delta('a')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
  File ""<stdin>"", line 5, in delta
ValueError: delta should only be called with numerical arguments
>>> delta('a', 'b')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
  File ""<stdin>"", line 5, in delta
ValueError: delta should only be called with numerical arguments
>>> delta('a', 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
  File ""<stdin>"", line 5, in delta
ValueError: delta should only be called with numerical arguments
>>> delta(3, 4.5)
1.5
>>> delta(3, 5, 7, 2)
5
If you really don't want to raise an exception when delta is called without any argument, you could return some value which cannot be possible otherwise (e.g. -1 or None):
>>> def delta(*numbers):
...     try:
...         return max(numbers) - min(numbers)
...     except TypeError:
...         raise ValueError(""delta should only be called with numerical arguments"") from None
...     except ValueError:
...         return -1 # or None
... 
>>> 
>>> delta()

I would like to add to this question that it not only legit and reliable but it also ultra practical. Here is a simple example:
>>>example_list = []
>>>print example_list or 'empty list'
empty list
Therefore you can really use it at your advantage. In order to be conscise this is how I see it:
Or operator
Python's or operator returns the first Truth-y value, or the last value, and stops
And operator
Python's and operator returns the first False-y value, or the last value, and stops
Behind the scenes
In python, all numbers are interpreted as True except for 0. Therefore, saying:
0 and 10 
is the same as:
False and True
Which is clearly False. It is therefore logical that it returns 0",2017-10-30 03:39:25Z,0
2890,47007680,emmanuelsa,3450026,"Yes. This is the correct behaviour of and comparison.
At least in Python, A and B returns B if A is essentially True including if A is NOT Null, NOT None NOT an Empty container (such as an empty list, dict, etc). A is returned IFF A is essentially False or None or Empty or Null.
On the other hand, A or B returns A if A is essentially True including if A is NOT Null, NOT None NOT an Empty container (such as an empty list, dict, etc), otherwise it returns B.
It is easy to not notice (or to overlook) this behaviour because, in Python, any non-null non-empty object evaluates to True is treated like a boolean.
For example, all the following will print ""True""
if [102]: 
    print ""True""
else: 
    print ""False""

if ""anything that is not empty or None"": 
    print ""True""
else: 
    print ""False""

if {1, 2, 3}:

AND : if first_val is False return first_val else second_value
eg:
1 and 2 # here it will return 2 because 1 is not False

0 and 2 # will return 0 because first value is 0 i.e False
and => if anyone false, it will be false. if both are true then only it will become true
OR : if first_val is False return second_val else first_value
reason is, if first is false it check whether 2 is true or not.
eg:
1 or 2 # here it will return 1 because 1 is not False
but,
0 or 2 # will return 2 because first value is 0 i.e False

This means the migration is perfectly fine. It means there is already data in the database that violates the constraint, so you will first need to go through the fact that there are Employer objects in the database with the same user and the same website.
You can find such Users effectively with:
from django.db.models import Count

Employee.objects.values('user', 'website').annotate(count=Count('pk')).filter(
    count__gt=1

then you will have to fix these Employer records.

The best answer we can give based on the limited information in the question is: MongoDB will probably use the index.

#!/usr/bin/env perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use Data::Dumper;


my $packed_output = pack ""L>*"", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6;
my $hex = sprintf ""%v02X"", $packed_output;
# $hex is
# 00.00.00.01.00.00.00.02.00.00.00.03.00.00.00.04.00.00.00.05.00.00.00.06

my $binary = pack ""(h2)*"", map(hex, split(/\./, $hex));

print Dumper($packed_output, $binary);

# $VAR1 = ""\0\0\0\1\0\0\0\2\0\0\0\3\0\0\0\4\0\0\0\5\0\0\0\6"";
# $VAR2 = ""\0\0\0\1\0\0\0\2\0\0\0\3\0\0\0\4\0\0\0\5\0\0\0\6"";
It sounds like what you're really after is an easy way to have a round-trip conversion between binary and textual data, though. Using sprintf to make a hex vector string like the above is not it.

PHP belongs to the C-style and imperative programming languages. It has rigid grammar rules, which it cannot recover from when encountering misplaced symbols or identifiers. It can't guess your coding intentions.
Most important tips
There are a few basic precautions you can always take:
Use proper code indentation, or adopt any lofty coding style. Readability prevents irregularities.
Use an IDE or editor for PHP with syntax highlighting. Which also help with parentheses/bracket balancing.
Read the language reference and examples in the manual. Twice, to become somewhat proficient.
How to interpret parser errors
A typical syntax error message reads:
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING, expecting ';' in file.php on line 217
Which lists the possible location of a syntax mistake. See the mentioned file name and line number.
A moniker such as T_STRING explains which symbol the parser/tokenizer couldn't process finally. This isn't necessarily the cause of the syntax mistake, however.
It's important to look into previous code lines as well. Often syntax errors are just mishaps that happened earlier. The error line number is just where the parser conclusively gave up to process it all.
Solving syntax errors
There are many approaches to narrow down and fix syntax hiccups.
Open the mentioned source file. Look at the mentioned code line.
For runaway strings and misplaced operators, this is usually where you find the culprit.
Read the line left to right and imagine what each symbol does.
More regularly you need to look at preceding lines as well.
In particular, missing ; semicolons are missing at the previous line ends/statement. (At least from the stylistic viewpoint. )
If { code blocks } are incorrectly closed or nested, you may need to investigate even further up the source code. Use proper code indentation to simplify that.
Look at the syntax colorization!
Strings and variables and constants should all have different colors.
Operators +-*/. should be tinted distinct as well. Else they might be in the wrong context.
If you see string colorization extend too far or too short, then you have found an unescaped or missing closing "" or ' string marker.
Having two same-colored punctuation characters next to each other can also mean trouble. Usually, operators are lone if it's not ++, --, or parentheses following an operator. Two strings/identifiers directly following each other are incorrect in most contexts.
Whitespace is your friend. Follow any coding style.
Break up long lines temporarily.
You can freely add newlines between operators or constants and strings. The parser will then concretize the line number for parsing errors. Instead of looking at the very lengthy code, you can isolate the missing or misplaced syntax symbol.
Split up complex if statements into distinct or nested if conditions.
Instead of lengthy math formulas or logic chains, use temporary variables to simplify the code. (More readable = fewer errors.)
Add newlines between:
The code you can easily identify as correct,
The parts you're unsure about,
And the lines which the parser complains about.
Partitioning up long code blocks really helps to locate the origin of syntax errors.
Comment out offending code.
If you can't isolate the problem source, start to comment out (and thus temporarily remove) blocks of code.
As soon as you got rid of the parsing error, you have found the problem source. Look more closely there.
Sometimes you want to temporarily remove complete function/method blocks. (In case of unmatched curly braces and wrongly indented code.)
When you can't resolve the syntax issue, try to rewrite the commented out sections from scratch.
As a newcomer, avoid some of the confusing syntax constructs.
The ternary ? : condition operator can compact code and is useful indeed. But it doesn't aid readability in all cases. Prefer plain if statements while unversed.
PHP's alternative syntax (if:/elseif:/endif;) is common for templates, but arguably less easy to follow than normal { code } blocks.
The most prevalent newcomer mistakes are:
Missing semicolons ; for terminating statements/lines.
Mismatched string quotes for "" or ' and unescaped quotes within.
Forgotten operators, in particular for the string . concatenation.
Unbalanced ( parentheses ). Count them in the reported line. Are there an equal number of them?
Don't forget that solving one syntax problem can uncover the next.
If you make one issue go away, but other crops up in some code below, you're mostly on the right path.
If after editing a new syntax error crops up in the same line, then your attempted change was possibly a failure. (Not always though.)
Restore a backup of previously working code, if you can't fix it.
Adopt a source code versioning system. You can always view a diff of the broken and last working version. Which might be enlightening as to what the syntax problem is.
Invisible stray Unicode characters: In some cases, you need to use a hexeditor or different editor/viewer on your source. Some problems cannot be found just from looking at your code.
Try grep --color -P -n ""\[\x80-\xFF\]"" file.php as the first measure to find non-ASCII symbols.
In particular BOMs, zero-width spaces, or non-breaking spaces, and smart quotes regularly can find their way into the source code.
Take care of which type of linebreaks are saved in files.
PHP just honors \n newlines, not \r carriage returns.
Which is occasionally an issue for MacOS users (even on OS  X for misconfigured editors).
It often only surfaces as an issue when single-line // or # comments are used. Multiline /*...*/ comments do seldom disturb the parser when linebreaks get ignored.
If your syntax error does not transmit over the web: It happens that you have a syntax error on your machine. But posting the very same file online does not exhibit it anymore. Which can only mean one of two things:
You are looking at the wrong file!
Or your code contained invisible stray Unicode (see above). You can easily find out: Just copy your code back from the web form into your text editor.
Check your PHP version. Not all syntax constructs are available on every server.
php -v for the command line interpreter
<?php phpinfo(); for the one invoked through the webserver.

Those aren't necessarily the same. In particular when working with frameworks, you will them to match up.
Don't use PHP's reserved keywords as identifiers for functions/methods, classes or constants.
Trial-and-error is your last resort.
If all else fails, you can always google your error message. Syntax symbols aren't as easy to search for (Stack Overflow itself is indexed by SymbolHound though). Therefore it may take looking through a few more pages before you find something relevant.

White screen of death
If your website is just blank, then typically a syntax error is the cause. Enable their display with:
error_reporting = E_ALL
display_errors = 1
In your php.ini generally, or via .htaccess for mod_php, or even .user.ini with FastCGI setups.
Enabling it within the broken script is too late because PHP can't even interpret/run the first line. A quick workaround is crafting a wrapper script, say test.php:
<?php
   error_reporting(E_ALL);
   ini_set(""display_errors"", 1);
   include(""./broken-script.php"");
Then invoke the failing code by accessing this wrapper script.

I would even say that working without an IDE is kind of unprofessional. Why? Because modern IDEs check your syntax after every character you type.

You'll (effectively) never run into syntax errors again, simply because you see them right as you type. Seriously.

2936,18050071,"4 revs, 4 users 81%",29505827,"Unexpected [
These days, the unexpected [ array bracket is commonly seen on outdated PHP versions. The short array syntax is available since PHP >= 5.4. Older installations only support array().
$php53 = array(1, 2, 3);
$php54 = [1, 2, 3];
         ⇑
Array function result dereferencing is likewise not available for older PHP versions:
$result = get_whatever()[""key""];
                      ⇑
Reference - What does this error mean in PHP? - ""Syntax error, unexpected \["" shows the most common and practical workarounds.
Though, you're always better off just upgrading your PHP installation. For shared webhosting plans, first research if e.g. SetHandler php56-fcgi can be used to enable a newer runtime.

BTW, there are also preprocessors and PHP 5.4 syntax down-converters if you're really clingy with older + slower PHP versions.
Other causes for Unexpected [ syntax errors
If it's not the PHP version mismatch, then it's oftentimes a plain typo or newcomer syntax mistake:
You can't use array property declarations/expressions in classes, not even in PHP 7.
protected $var[""x""] = ""Nope"";
              ⇑
Confusing [ with opening curly braces { or parentheses ( is a common oversight.
foreach [$a as $b)
        ⇑
Or even:
function foobar[$a, $b, $c] {
               ⇑
Or trying to dereference constants (before PHP 5.6) as arrays:
$var = const[123];
       ⇑
At least PHP interprets that const as a constant name.
If you meant to access an array variable (which is the typical cause here), then add the leading $ sigil - so it becomes a $varname.
You are trying to use the global keyword on a member of an associative array. This is not valid syntax:
global $var['key'];

Unexpected ] closing square bracket
This is somewhat rarer, but there are also syntax accidents with the terminating array ] bracket.
Again mismatches with ) parentheses or } curly braces are common:
function foobar($a, $b, $c] {
                          ⇑
Or trying to end an array where there isn't one:
$var = 2];
Which often occurs in multi-line and nested array declarations.
$array = [1,[2,3],4,[5,6[7,[8],[9,10]],11],12]],15];
                                             ⇑
If so, use your IDE for bracket matching to find any premature ] array closure. At the very least use more spacing and newlines to narrow it down.",2019-01-02 12:26:17Z,61
2937,18050071,"9 revs, 6 users 89%",18092267,"Unexpected T_VARIABLE
An ""unexpected T_VARIABLE"" means that there's a literal $variable name, which doesn't fit into the current expression/statement structure.
Missing semicolon
It most commonly indicates a missing semicolon in the previous line. Variable assignments following a statement are a good indicator where to look:
        ⇓
 func1()
 $var = 1 + 2;     # parse error in line +2
String concatenation
A frequent mishap are string concatenations with forgotten . operator:
                                ⇓
 print ""Here comes the value: ""  $value;
Btw, you should prefer string interpolation (basic variables in double quotes) whenever that helps readability. Which avoids these syntax issues.
String interpolation is a scripting language core feature. No shame in utilizing it. Ignore any micro-optimization advise about variable . concatenation being faster. It's not.
Missing expression operators
Of course the same issue can arise in other expressions, for instance arithmetic operations:
            ⇓
 print 4 + 7 $var;
PHP can't guess here if the variable should have been added, subtracted or compared etc.
Lists
Same for syntax lists, like in array populations, where the parser also indicates an expected comma , for example:
                                       ⇓
 $var = array(""1"" => $val, $val2, $val3 $val4);
Or functions parameter lists:
                                 ⇓
 function myfunc($param1, $param2 $param3, $param4)
Equivalently do you see this with list or global statements, or when lacking a ; semicolon in a for loop.
Class declarations
This parser error also occurs in class declarations. You can only assign static constants, not expressions. Thus the parser complains about variables as assigned data:
 class xyz {      ⇓
     var $value = $_GET[""input""];
Unmatched } closing curly braces can in particular lead here. If a method is terminated too early (use proper indentation!), then a stray variable is commonly misplaced into the class declaration body.
Variables after identifiers
You can also never have a variable follow an identifier directly:
              ⇓
 $this->myFunc$VAR();
Btw, this is a common example where the intention was to use variable variables perhaps. In this case a variable property lookup with $this->{""myFunc$VAR""}(); for example.
Take in mind that using variable variables should be the exception. Newcomers often try to use them too casually, even when arrays would be simpler and more appropriate.
Missing parentheses after language constructs
Hasty typing may lead to forgotten opening or closing parenthesis for if and for and foreach statements:
        ⇓
 foreach $array as $key) {
Solution: add the missing opening ( between statement and variable.
                       ⇓
 if ($var = pdo_query($sql) {
      $result = …
The curly { brace does not open the code block, without closing the if expression with the ) closing parenthesis first.
Else does not expect conditions
     ⇓
else ($var >= 0)
Solution: Remove the conditions from else or use elseif.
Need brackets for closure
     ⇓
function() use $var {}
Solution: Add brackets around $var.
Invisible whitespace
As mentioned in the reference answer on ""Invisible stray Unicode"" (such as a non-breaking space), you might also see this error for unsuspecting code like:
<?php
                          ⇐
$var = new PDO(...);
It's rather prevalent in the start of files and for copy-and-pasted code. Check with a hexeditor, if your code does not visually appear to contain a syntax issue.

2938,18050071,"7 revs, 3 users 95%",18092288,"Unexpected T_CONSTANT_ENCAPSED_STRING
Unexpected T_ENCAPSED_AND_WHITESPACE
The unwieldy names T_CONSTANT_ENCAPSED_STRING and T_ENCAPSED_AND_WHITESPACE refer to quoted ""string"" literals.
They're used in different contexts, but the syntax issue are quite similar. T_ENCAPSED… warnings occur in double quoted string context, while T_CONSTANT… strings are often astray in plain PHP expressions or statements.
Incorrect variable interpolation
And it comes up most frequently for incorrect PHP variable interpolation:
                          ⇓     ⇓
echo ""Here comes a $wrong['array'] access"";
Quoting arrays keys is a must in PHP context. But in double quoted strings (or HEREDOCs) this is a mistake. The parser complains about the contained single quoted 'string', because it usually expects a literal identifier / key there.
More precisely it's valid to use PHP2-style simple syntax within double quotes for array references:
echo ""This is only $valid[here] ..."";
Nested arrays or deeper object references however require the complex curly string expression syntax:
echo ""Use {$array['as_usual']} with curly syntax."";
If unsure, this is commonly safer to use. It's often even considered more readable. And better IDEs actually use distinct syntax colorization for that.
Missing concatenation
If a string follows an expression, but lacks a concatenation or other operator, then you'll see PHP complain about the string literal:
                       ⇓
print ""Hello "" . WORLD  "" !"";
While it's obvious to you and me, PHP just can't guess that the string was meant to be appended there.
Confusing string quote enclosures
The same syntax error occurs when confounding string delimiters. A string started by a single ' or double "" quote also ends with the same.
                ⇓
print ""<a href=""' . $link . '"">click here</a>"";
      ⌞⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⌟⌞⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⌟⌞⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⎽⌟
That example started with double quotes. But double quotes were also destined for the HTML attributes. The intended concatenation operator within however became interpreted as part of a second string in single quotes.
Tip: Set your editor/IDE to use slightly distinct colorization for single and double quoted strings. (It also helps with application logic to prefer e.g. double quoted strings for textual output, and single quoted strings only for constant-like values.)
This is a good example where you shouldn't break out of double quotes in the first place. Instead just use proper \"" escapes for the HTML attributes´ quotes:
print ""<a href=\""{$link}\"">click here</a>"";
While this can also lead to syntax confusion, all better IDEs/editors again help by colorizing the escaped quotes differently.
Missing opening quote
Equivalently are forgotten opening ""/' quotes a recipe for parser errors:
               ⇓
 make_url(login', 'open');
Here the ', ' would become a string literal after a bareword, when obviously login was meant to be a string parameter.
Array lists
If you miss a , comma in an array creation block, the parser will see two consecutive strings:
array(               ⇓
     ""key"" => ""value""
     ""next"" => ""...."",
);
Note that the last line may always contain an extra comma, but overlooking one in between is unforgivable. Which is hard to discover without syntax highlighting.
Function parameter lists
The same thing for function calls:
                         ⇓
myfunc(123, ""text"", ""and""  ""more"")
Runaway strings
A common variation are quite simply forgotten string terminators:
                                ⇓
mysql_evil(""SELECT * FROM stuffs);
print ""'ok'"";
      ⇑
Here PHP complains about two string literals directly following each other. But the real cause is the unclosed previous string of course.
HEREDOC indentation
Prior PHP 7.3, the heredoc string end delimiter can't be prefixed with spaces:
print <<< HTML
    <link..>
    HTML;
   ⇑
Solution: upgrade PHP or find a better hoster.

2939,18050071,"9 revs, 6 users 73%",18092277,"Unexpected T_STRING
T_STRING is a bit of a misnomer. It does not refer to a quoted ""string"". It means a raw identifier was encountered. This can range from bare words to leftover CONSTANT or function names, forgotten unquoted strings, or any plain text.
Misquoted strings
This syntax error is most common for misquoted string values however. Any unescaped and stray "" or ' quote will form an invalid expression:
               ⇓                  ⇓
 echo ""<a href=""http://example.com"">click here</a>"";
Syntax highlighting will make such mistakes super obvious. It's important to remember to use backslashes for escaping \"" double quotes, or \' single quotes - depending on which was used as string enclosure.
For convenience you should prefer outer single quotes when outputting plain HTML with double quotes within.
Use double quoted strings if you want to interpolate variables, but then watch out for escaping literal "" double quotes.
For lengthier output, prefer multiple echo/print lines instead of escaping in and out. Better yet consider a HEREDOC section.

Another example is using PHP entry inside HTML code generated with PHP:
$text = '<div>some text with <?php echo 'some php entry' ?></div>'
This happens if $text is large with many lines and developer does not see the whole PHP variable value and focus on the piece of code forgetting about its source. Example is here
See also What is the difference between single-quoted and double-quoted strings in PHP?.
Unclosed strings
If you miss a closing "" then a syntax error typically materializes later. An unterminated string will often consume a bit of code until the next intended string value:
                                                       ⇓
echo ""Some text"", $a_variable, ""and some runaway string ;
success(""finished"");
         ⇯
It's not just literal T_STRINGs which the parser may protest then. Another frequent variation is an Unexpected '>' for unquoted literal HTML.
Non-programming string quotes
If you copy and paste code from a blog or website, you sometimes end up with invalid code. Typographic quotes aren't what PHP expects:
$text = ’Something something..’ + ”these ain't quotes”;
Typographic/smart quotes are Unicode symbols. PHP treats them as part of adjoining alphanumeric text. For example ”these is interpreted as a constant identifier. But any following text literal is then seen as a bareword/T_STRING by the parser.
The missing semicolon; again
If you have an unterminated expression in previous lines, then any following statement or language construct gets seen as raw identifier:
       ⇓
func1()
function2();
PHP just can't know if you meant to run two functions after another, or if you meant to multiply their results, add them, compare them, or only run one || or the other.
Short open tags and <?xml headers in PHP scripts
This is rather uncommon. But if short_open_tags are enabled, then you can't begin your PHP scripts with an XML declaration:
      ⇓
<?xml version=""1.0""?>
PHP will see the <? and reclaim it for itself. It won't understand what the stray xml was meant for. It'll get interpreted as constant. But the version will be seen as another literal/constant. And since the parser can't make sense of two subsequent literals/values without an expression operator in between, that'll be a parser failure.
Invisible Unicode characters
A most hideous cause for syntax errors are Unicode symbols, such as the non-breaking space. PHP allows Unicode characters as identifier names. If you get a T_STRING parser complaint for wholly unsuspicious code like:
<?php
    print 123;
You need to break out another text editor. Or an hexeditor even. What looks like plain spaces and newlines here, may contain invisible constants. Java-based IDEs are sometimes oblivious to an UTF-8 BOM mangled within, zero-width spaces, paragraph separators, etc. Try to reedit everything, remove whitespace and add normal spaces back in.
You can narrow it down with with adding redundant ; statement separators at each line start:
<?php
    ;print 123;
The extra ; semicolon here will convert the preceding invisible character into an undefined constant reference (expression as statement). Which in return makes PHP produce a helpful notice.
The `$` sign missing in front of variable names
Variables in PHP are represented by a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable.
The dollar sign ($) is a sigil that marks the identifier as a name of a variable. Without this sigil, the identifier could be a language keyword or a constant.
This is a common error when the PHP code was ""translated"" from code written in another language (C, Java, JavaScript, etc.). In such cases, a declaration of the variable type (when the original code was written in a language that uses typed variables) could also sneak out and produce this error.
Escaped Quotation marks
If you use \ in a string, it has a special meaning. This is called an ""Escape Character"" and normally tells the parser to take the next character literally.
Example: echo 'Jim said \'Hello\''; will print Jim said 'hello'
If you escape the closing quote of a string, the closing quote will be taken literally and not as intended, i.e. as a printable quote as part of the string and not close the string. This will show as a parse error commonly after you open the next string or at the end of the script.
Very common error when specifiying paths in Windows: ""C:\xampp\htdocs\"" is wrong. You need ""C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\"".
Typed properties
You need PHP ≥7.4 to use property typing such as:
public stdClass $obj;",2020-08-16 22:44:21Z,30
2940,18050071,"7 revs, 3 users 91%",18092308,"Unexpected (
Opening parentheses typically follow language constructs such as if/foreach/for/array/list or start an arithmetic expression. They're syntactically incorrect after ""strings"", a previous (), a lone $, and in some typical declaration contexts.
Function declaration parameters
A rarer occurrence for this error is trying to use expressions as default function parameters. This is not supported, even in PHP7:
function header_fallback($value, $expires = time() + 90000) {
Parameters in a function declaration can only be literal values or constant expressions. Unlike for function invocations, where you can freely use whatever(1+something()*2), etc.
Class property defaults
Same thing for class member declarations, where only literal/constant values are allowed, not expressions:
class xyz {                   ⇓
    var $default = get_config(""xyz_default"");
Put such things in the constructor. See also Why don't PHP attributes allow functions?
Again note that PHP 7 only allows var $xy = 1 + 2 +3; constant expressions there.
JavaScript syntax in PHP
Using JavaScript or jQuery syntax won't work in PHP for obvious reasons:
<?php      ⇓
    print $(document).text();
When this happens, it usually indicates an unterminated preceding string; and literal <script> sections leaking into PHP code context.
isset(()), empty, key, next, current
Both isset() and empty() are language built-ins, not functions. They need to access a variable directly. If you inadvertently add a pair of parentheses too much, then you'd create an expression however:
          ⇓
if (isset(($_GET[""id""]))) {
The same applies to any language construct that requires implicit variable name access. These built-ins are part of the language grammar, therefore don't permit decorative extra parentheses.
User-level functions that require a variable reference -but get an expression result passed- lead to runtime errors instead.

Unexpected )
Absent function parameter
You cannot have stray commas last in a function call. PHP expects a value there and thusly complains about an early closing ) parenthesis.
              ⇓
callfunc(1, 2, );
A trailing comma is only allowed in array() or list() constructs.
Unfinished expressions
If you forget something in an arithmetic expression, then the parser gives up. Because how should it possibly interpret that:
               ⇓
$var = 2 * (1 + );
And if you forgot the closing ) even, then you'd get a complaint about the unexpected semicolon instead.
Foreach as constant
For forgotten variable $ prefixes in control statements you will see:
                   ↓    ⇓
foreach ($array as wrong) {
PHP here sometimes tells you it expected a :: instead. Because a class::$variable could have satisfied the expected $variable expression..

Unexpected {
Curly braces { and } enclose code blocks. And syntax errors about them usually indicate some incorrect nesting.
Unmatched subexpressions in an if
Most commonly unbalanced ( and ) are the cause if the parser complains about the opening curly { appearing too early. A simple example:
                              ⇓
if (($x == $y) && (2 == true) {
Count your parentheses or use an IDE which helps with that. Also don't write code without any spaces. Readability counts.
{ and } in expression context
You can't use curly braces in expressions. If you confuse parentheses and curlys, it won't comply to the language grammar:
           ⇓
$var = 5 * {7 + $x};
There are a few exceptions for identifier construction, such as local scope variable ${references}.
Variable variables or curly var expressions
This is pretty rare. But you might also get { and } parser complaints for complex variable expressions:
                      ⇓
print ""Hello {$world[2{]} !"";
Though there's a higher likelihood for an unexpected } in such contexts.

Unexpected }
When getting an ""unexpected }"" error, you've mostly closed a code block too early.
Last statement in a code block
It can happen for any unterminated expression.
And if the last line in a function/code block lacks a trailing ; semicolon:
function whatever() {
    doStuff()
}            ⇧
Here the parser can't tell if you perhaps still wanted to add + 25; to the function result or something else.
Invalid block nesting / Forgotten {
You'll sometimes see this parser error when a code block was } closed too early, or you forgot an opening { even:
function doStuff() {
    if (true)    ⇦
        print ""yes"";
    }
}   ⇧
In above snippet the if didn't have an opening { curly brace. Thus the closing } one below became redundant. And therefore the next closing }, which was intended for the function, was not associable to the original opening { curly brace.
Such errors are even harder to find without proper code indentation. Use an IDE and bracket matching.

Unexpected {, expecting (
Language constructs which require a condition/declaration header and a code block will trigger this error.
Parameter lists
For example misdeclared functions without parameter list are not permitted:
                 ⇓
function whatever {
}
Control statement conditions
And you can't likewise have an if without condition.
  ⇓
if {
}

Unexpected T_ENDIF
Conditional control blocks if, elseif and else follow a simple structure. When you encounter a syntax error, it's most likely just invalid block nesting → with missing { curly braces } - or one too many.
Missing { or } due to incorrect indentation
Mismatched code braces are common to less well-formatted code such as:
if((!($opt[""uniQartz5.8""]!=$this->check58)) or (empty($_POST['poree']))) {if
($true) {echo""halp"";} elseif((!$z)or%b){excSmthng(False,5.8)}elseif (False){
If your code looks like this, start afresh! Otherwise it's unfixable to you or anyone else. There's no point in showcasing this on the internet to inquire for help.
You will only be able to fix it, if you can visually follow the nested structure and relation of if/else conditionals and their { code blocks }. Use your IDE to see if they're all paired.
if (true) {
     if (false) {
              …
     }
     elseif ($whatever) {
         if ($something2) {
             …
         } 
         else {
             …
         }
     }
     else {
         …
     }
     if (false) {    //   a second `if` tree
         …
     }
     else {
         …
     }
}
elseif (false) {
    …
}
Any double } } will not just close a branch, but a previous condition structure. Therefore stick with one coding style; don't mix and match in nested if/else trees.
Apart from consistency here, it turns out helpful to avoid lengthy conditions too. Use temporary variables or functions to avoid unreadable if-expressions.
IF cannot be used in expressions
A surprisingly frequent newcomer mistake is trying to use an if statement in an expression, such as a print statement:
                   ⇓
echo ""<a href='"" . if ($link == ""example.org"") { echo …
Which is invalid of course.
You can use a ternary conditional, but beware of readability impacts.
echo ""<a href='"" . ($link ? ""http://yes"" : ""http://no"") . ""</a>"";
Otherwise break such output constructs up: use multiple ifs and echos.
Better yet, use temporary variables, and place your conditionals before:
if ($link) { $href = ""yes""; } else { $href = ""no""; }
echo ""<a href='$href'>Link</a>"";
Defining functions or methods for such cases often makes sense too.
Control blocks don't return ""results""
Now this is less common, but a few coders even try to treat if as if it could return a result:
$var = if ($x == $y) { ""true"" };
Which is structurally identical to using if within a string concatenation / expression.
But control structures (if / foreach / while) don't have a ""result"".
The literal string ""true"" would also just be a void statement.

You'll have to use an assignment in the code block:
if ($x == $y) { $var = ""true""; }
Alternatively, resort to a ?: ternary comparison.
If in If
You cannot nest an if within a condition either:
                    ⇓
if ($x == true and (if $y != false)) { ... }
Which is obviously redundant, because the and (or or) already allows chaining comparisons.
Forgotten ; semicolons
Once more: Each control block needs to be a statement. If the previous code piece isn't terminated by a semicolon, then that's a guaranteed syntax error:
                ⇓
$var = 1 + 2 + 3
if (true) { … }
Btw, the last line in a {…} code block needs a semicolon too.
Semicolon too early
Now it's probably wrong to blame a particular coding style, as this pitfall is too easy to overlook:
            ⇓
if ($x == 5);
{
    $y = 7;
}
else           ←
{
    $x = -1;    
}
Which happens more often than you might imagine.
When you terminate the if () expression with ; it will execute a void statement. The ; becomes a an empty {} of its own!
The {…} block thus is detached from the if, and would always run.
So the else no longer had a relation to an open if construct, which is why this would lead to an Unexpected T_ELSE syntax error.

Which also explains a likewise subtle variation of this syntax error:
if ($x) { x_is_true(); }; else { something_else(); };
Where the ; after the code block {…} terminates the whole if construct, severing the else branch syntactically.
Not using code blocks
It's syntactically allowed to omit curly braces {…} for code blocks in if/elseif/else branches. Which sadly is a syntax style very common to unversed coders. (Under the false assumption this was quicker to type or read).
However that's highly likely to trip up the syntax. Sooner or later additional statements will find their way into the if/else branches:
if (true)
    $x = 5;
elseif (false)
    $x = 6;
    $y = 7;     ←
else
    $z = 0;
But to actually use code blocks, you do have to write {…} them as such!
Even seasoned programmers avoid this braceless syntax, or at least understand it as an exceptional exception to the rule.
Else / Elseif in wrong order
One thing to remind yourself is the conditional order, of course.
if ($a) { … }
else { … }
elseif ($b) { … }
↑
You can have as many elseifs as you want, but else has to go last. That's just how it is.
Class declarations
As mentioned above, you can't have control statements in a class declaration:
class xyz {
    if (true) {
        function ($var) {}
    }
You either forgot a function definition, or closed one } too early in such cases.
Unexpected T_ELSEIF / T_ELSE
When mixing PHP and HTML, the closing } for an if/elseif must be in the same PHP block <?php ?> as the next elseif/else. This will generate an error as the closing } for the if needs to be part of the elseif:
<?php if ($x) { ?>
    html
<?php } ?>
<?php elseif ($y) { ?>
    html
<?php } ?>
The correct form <?php } elseif:
<?php if ($x) { ?>
    html
<?php } elseif ($y) { ?>
    html
<?php } ?>
This is more or less a variation of incorrect indentation - presumably often based on wrong coding intentions.
You cannot mash other statements inbetween if and elseif/else structural tokens:
if (true) {
}
echo ""in between"";    ←
elseif (false) {
}
?> text <?php      ←
else {
}
Either can only occur in {…} code blocks, not in between control structure tokens.
This wouldn't make sense anyway. It's not like that there was some ""undefined"" state when PHP jumps between if and else branches.
You'll have to make up your mind where print statements belong to / or if they need to be repeated in both branches.

Nor can you part an if/else between different control structures:
foreach ($array as $i) {
    if ($i) { … }
}
else { … }
There is no syntactic relation between the if and else. The foreach lexical scope ends at }, so there's no point for the if structure to continue.
T_ENDIF
If an unexpected T_ENDIF is complained about, you're using the alternative syntax style if: ⋯ elseif: ⋯ else: ⋯ endif;. Which you should really think twice about.
A common pitfall is confusing the eerily similar : colon for a ; semicolon. (Covered in ""Semicolon too early"")
As indentation is harder to track in template files, the more when using the alternative syntax - it's plausible your endif; does not match any if:.
Using } endif; is a doubled if-terminator.

While an ""unexpected $end"" is usually the price for a forgotten closing } curly brace.
Assignment vs. comparison
So, this is not a syntax error, but worth mentioning in this context:
       ⇓
if ($x = true) { }
else { do_false(); }
That's not a ==/=== comparison, but an = assignment. This is rather subtle, and will easily lead some users to helplessly edit whole condition blocks. Watch out for unintended assignments first - whenver you experience a logic fault / misbeheviour.",2019-10-10 20:01:53Z,15
2942,18050071,"8 revs, 5 users 69%",29500670,"Unexpected $end
When PHP talks about an ""unexpected $end"", it means that your code ended while the parser is expecting more code. (The message is a bit misleading when taken literally. It's not about a variable named ""$end"", as sometimes assumed by newcomers. It refers to the ""end of file"", EOF.)
Cause: Unbalanced { and } for code blocks / and function or class declarations.
It's pretty much always about a missing } curly brace to close preceding code blocks. What it's saying is that the parser is expecting to find a closing } but actually reached the end of the file.
Again, use proper indentation to avoid such issues.
Use an IDE with bracket matching, to find out where the } is amiss. There are keyboard shortcuts in most IDEs and text editors:
NetBeans, PhpStorm, Komodo: Ctrl[ and Ctrl]
Eclipse, Aptana: CtrlShiftP
Atom, Sublime: Ctrlm - Zend Studio CtrlM
Geany, Notepad++: CtrlB - Joe: CtrlG - Emacs: C-M-n - Vim: %
Most IDEs also highlight matching braces, brackets and parentheses. Which makes it pretty easy to inspect their correlation:
Unterminated expressions
An Unexpected $end syntax/parser error can also occur for unterminated expressions or statements:
$var = func(1,  ?>EOF
So, look at the end of scripts first. A trailing ; is often redundant for the last statement in any PHP script. But you should have one. Precisely because it narrows such syntax issues down. Particularly after you find yourself adding more statements at the end of the script.
Indented HEREDOC markers
Another common occurrence appears with HEREDOC or NOWDOC strings. The terminating marker goes ignored with leading spaces, tabs, etc.:
print <<< END
    Content...
    Content....
  END;
# ↑ terminator isn't exactly at the line start
Therefore the parser assumes the HEREDOC string to continue until the end of the file (hence ""Unexpected $end""). Pretty much all IDEs and syntax-highlighting editors will make this obvious or warn about it.
Escaped Quotation marks
If you use \ in a string, it has a special meaning. This is called an ""Escape Character"" and normally tells the parser to take the next character literally.
Example: echo 'Jim said \'Hello\''; will print Jim said 'hello'
If you escape the closing quote of a string, the closing quote will be taken literally and not as intended, i.e. as a printable quote as part of the string and not close the string. This will show as a parse error commonly after you open the next string or at the end of the script.
Very common error when specifying paths in Windows: ""C:\xampp\htdocs\"" is wrong. You need ""C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\"". Alternately, PHP will usually convert Unix-style paths (e.g. ""C:/xampp/htdocs/"") to the correct path for Windows.
Alternative syntax
Somewhat rarer you can see this syntax error when using the alternative syntax for statement/code blocks in templates. Using if: and else: and a missing endif; for example.

Comparison operators such as ==, >=, ===, !=, <>, !== and <= or < and > mostly should be used just in expressions, such as if expressions. If the parser complains about them, then it often means incorrect paring or mismatched ( ) parens around them.
Parens grouping
In particular for if statements with multiple comparisons you must take care to correctly count opening and closing parenthesis:
                        ⇓
if (($foo < 7) && $bar) > 5 || $baz < 9) { ... }
                      ↑
Here the if condition here was already terminated by the )
Once your comparisons become sufficiently complex it often helps to split it up into multiple and nested if constructs rather.
isset() mashed with comparing
A common newcomer is pitfal is trying to combine isset() or empty() with comparisons:
                        ⇓
if (empty($_POST[""var""] == 1)) {
Or even:
                    ⇓
if (isset($variable !== ""value"")) {
This doesn't make sense to PHP, because isset and empty are language constructs that only accept variable names. It doesn't make sense to compare the result either, because the output is only/already a boolean.
Confusing >= greater-or-equal with => array operator
Both operators look somewhat similar, so they sometimes get mixed up:
         ⇓
if ($var => 5) { ... }
You only need to remember that this comparison operator is called ""greater than or equal"" to get it right.
See also: If statement structure in PHP
Nothing to compare against
You also can't combine two comparisons if they pertain the same variable name:
                 ⇓
if ($xyz > 5 and < 100)
PHP can't deduce that you meant to compare the initial variable again. Expressions are usually paired according to operator precedence, so by the time the < is seen, there'd be only a boolean result left from the original variable.
See also: unexpected T_IS_SMALLER_OR_EQUAL
Comparison chains
You can't compare against a variable with a row of operators:
                  ⇓
 $reult = (5 < $x < 10);
This has to be broken up into two comparisons, each against $x.
This is actually more a case of blacklisted expressions (due to equivalent operator associativity). It's syntactically valid in a few C-style languages, but PHP wouldn't interpret it as expected comparison chain either.
Unexpected >
Unexpected <
The greater than > or less than < operators don't have a custom T_XXX tokenizer name. And while they can be misplaced like all they others, you more often see the parser complain about them for misquoted strings and mashed HTML:
                        ⇓
print ""<a href='z"">Hello</a>"";
                 ↑
This amounts to a string ""<a href='z"" being compared > to a literal constant Hello and then another < comparison. Or that's at least how PHP sees it. The actual cause and syntax mistake was the premature string "" termination.
It's also not possible to nest PHP start tags:
<?php echo <?php my_func(); ?>

Control constructs such as if, foreach, for, while, list, global, return, do, print, echo may only be used as statements. They usually reside on a line by themselves.
Semicolon; where you at?
Pretty universally have you missed a semicolon in the previous line if the parser complains about a control statement:
             ⇓
$x = myfunc()
if (true) {
Solution: look into the previous line; add semicolon.
Class declarations
Another location where this occurs is in class declarations. In the class section you can only list property initializations and method sections. No code may reside there.
class xyz {
    if (true) {}
    foreach ($var) {}
Such syntax errors commonly materialize for incorrectly nested { and }. In particular when function code blocks got closed too early.
Statements in expression context
Most language constructs can only be used as statements. They aren't meant to be placed inside other expressions:
                   ⇓
$var = array(1, 2, foreach($else as $_), 5, 6);
Likewise can't you use an if in strings, math expressions or elsewhere:
               ⇓
print ""Oh, "" . if (true) { ""you!"" } . "" won't work"";
// Use a ternary condition here instead, when versed enough.
For embedding if-like conditions in an expression specifically, you often want to use a ?: ternary evaluation.
The same applies to for, while, global, echo and a lesser extend list.
          ⇓
echo 123, echo 567, ""huh?"";
Whereas print() is a language built-in that may be used in expression context. (But rarely makes sense.)
Reserved keywords as identifiers
You also can't use do or if and other language constructs for user-defined functions or class names. (Perhaps in PHP 7. But even then it wouldn't be advisable.)
Your have a semi-colon instead of a colon (:) or curly bracket ({) after your control block
Control structures are typically wrapped in curly braces (but colons can be used in an alternative syntax) to represent their scope. If you accidentally use a semi-colon you prematurely close that block resulting in your closing statement throwing an error.

Invalid variable names
In PHP, and most other programming languages, variables cannot start with a number. The first character must be alphabetic or an underscore.
$1   // Bad
$_1  // Good
Quite often comes up for using preg_replace-placeholders ""$1"" in PHP context:
#                         ↓            ⇓  ↓
preg_replace(""/#(\w+)/e"",  strtopupper($1) )
Where the callback should have been quoted. (Now the /e regex flag has been deprecated. But it's sometimes still misused in preg_replace_callback functions.)
The same identifier constraint applies to object properties, btw.
       ↓
$json->0->value
While the tokenizer/parser does not allow a literal $1 as variable name, one could use ${1} or ${""1""}. Which is a syntactic workaround for non-standard identifiers. (It's best to think of it as a local scope lookup. But generally: prefer plain arrays for such cases!)
Amusingly, but very much not recommended, PHPs parser allows Unicode-identifiers; such that $➊ would be valid. (Unlike a literal 1).
Stray array entry
An unexpected long can also occur for array declarations - when missing , commas:
#            ↓ ↓
$xy = array(1 2 3);
Or likewise function calls and declarations, and other constructs:
func(1, 2  3);
function xy($z 2);
for ($i=2 3<$z)

So usually there's one of ; or , missing for separating lists or expressions.

And again, misquoted strings are a frequent source of stray numbers:

This is because of the python's automated garbage collection and it collects everything with a refcount of 0 when it destroys/leaves that frame/page/indented block of code.
The canonical way to deal with it is to have a list of images somewhere in the global namespace and add your image-references to that list. This is convenient but not very efficient and should be used for small applications.

global_image_list.append(tk.PhotoImage(file = 'test.png'))

A few caveats, though:
If you have alternation in your regex, be sure to enclose your regex in a non-capturing group before surrounding it with ^ and $:
^foo|bar$
is of course different from
^(?:foo|bar)$
Also, ^ and $ can take on a different meaning (start/end of line instead of start/end of string) if certain options are set. In text editors that support regular expressions, this is usually the default behaviour. In some languages, especially Ruby, this behaviour cannot even be switched off.
Therefore there is another set of anchors that are guaranteed to only match at the start/end of the entire string:
\A matches at the start of the string.
\Z matches at the end of the string or before a final line break.
\z matches at the very end of the string.

The two sides communicate via HTTP requests and responses. PHP is executed on the server and outputs some HTML and maybe JavaScript code which is sent as response to the client where the HTML is interpreted and the JavaScript is executed. Once PHP has finished outputting the response, the script ends and nothing will happen on the server until a new HTTP request comes in.
The example code executes like this:
<script type=""text/javascript"">
    var foo = 'bar';
    <?php
        file_put_contents('foo.txt', ' + foo + ');
    ?>

    var baz = <?php echo 42; ?>;
    alert(baz);
</script>
Step 1, PHP executes all code between <?php ?> tags. The result is this:
<script type=""text/javascript"">
    var foo = 'bar';

    var baz = 42;
    alert(baz);
</script>
The file_put_contents call did not result in anything, it just wrote "" + foo + "" into a file. The <?php echo 42; ?> call resulted in the output ""42"", which is now in the spot where that code used to be.
This resulting HTML/JavaScript code is now sent to the client, where it gets evaluated. The alert call works, while the foo variable is not used anywhere.
All PHP code is executed on the server before the client even starts executing any of the JavaScript. There's no PHP code left in the response that JavaScript could interact with.
To call some PHP code, the client will have to send a new HTTP request to the server. This can happen using one of three possible methods:
A link, which causes the browser to load a new page.
A form submission, which submits data to the server and loads a new page.
An AJAX request, which is a Javascript technique to make a regular HTTP request to the server (like 1. and 2. will), but without leaving the current page.
Here's a question outlining these method in greater detail
You can also use JavaScript to make the browser open a new page using window.location or submit a form, emulating possibilities 1. and 2.",2017-05-23 12:02:56Z,524
2984,13840429,SherylHohman,5411817,"To determine why PHP code doesn't work in JavaScript code we need to understand what client side and server side languages are, and how they work.
Server-side languages (PHP etc.): They retrieve records from databases, maintain state over the stateless HTTP connection, and do a lot of things that require security. They reside on the server, these programs never have their source code exposed to the user.
image attr
So you can easily see that server side languages handle HTTP requests and process them, and, as @deceze said, PHP is executed on the server and outputs some HTML, and maybe JavaScript code, which is sent as a response to the client, where the HTML is interpreted and JavaScript is executed.
On the other hand, Client Side Languages (like JavaScript) reside in browser and run in the browser. Client-side scripting generally refers to the class of computer programs on the web that are executed client-side, by the user's web browser, instead of server-side.
JavaScript is visible to the user and can be easily modified, so for security stuff we must not rely on JavaScript.
So when you make a HTTP request on server, the server first reads the PHP file carefully to see if there are any tasks that need to be executed, and sends a response to the client side. Again, as @deceze said, *Once PHP has finished outputting the response, the script ends and nothing will happen on the server until a new HTTP request comes in.*
Image source
So now what can I do if I need to call PHP? It depends how you need to do it: either by reloading the page or by using an AJAX call.
You can do so by reloading the page and sending a HTTP request
You can make an AJAX call with JavaScript - this does not require reloading page

The best way to think about this process is as if you're generating a text file dynamically. The text you're generating only becomes executable code once the browser interprets it. Only what you place between <?php tags is evaluated on the server.

Is the full table scan causing you problems? Locking? Too slow? How long does it take? How frequently are the tables synced? How many records are there in each table? What is the rate of change in each of the tables?
You could add separate indices on name and address but that will take a good chunk of space. The better option is going to be to add an indexed updatedAt column and use that to track which records have been changed.
ALTER TABLE `customersPrimary`
    ADD COLUMN `updatedAt` DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT '2000-01-01 00:00:00',
    ADD INDEX `idx_customer_primary_updated` (`updatedAt`);

ALTER TABLE `customersSecondary`
    ADD COLUMN `updatedAt` DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    ADD INDEX `idx_customer_secondary_updated` (`updatedAt`);
And then you can add updatedAt to your join criteria and the WHERE clause -
UPDATE customersPrimary cp
INNER JOIN customersSecondary cs
    ON cp.groupID = cs.groupID
    AND cp.IDInGroup =  cs.IDInGroup
    AND cp.updatedAt < cs.updatedAt
SET
    cp.name = cs.name, 
    cp.address = cs.address,
    cp.updatedAt = cs.updatedAt
WHERE cs.updatedAt > :last_query_run_time;
For :last_query_run_time you could use the last run time if you are storing it. Otherwise, if you know you are running the query every hour you could use NOW() - INTERVAL 65 MINUTE. Notice I have used more than one hour to make sure records aren't missed if there is a slight delay for some reason. Another option would be to use SELECT MAX(updatedAt) FROM customersPrimary -
UPDATE customersPrimary cp
INNER JOIN (SELECT MAX(updatedAt) maxUpdatedAt FROM customersPrimary) t

Since in oncreateView, you are trying to access view before even view is attached in the fragment layout tree.

Several things you can do. You can pass view to the recycler view function and access like view.rv_messages.
It's better to handle like the below.
Else you can move all view related to onViewCreated(). In onCreateView() you will just inflate and return the view. So in onViewCreated() when it calls getView() , since view is already added in onCreateView it will return the correct view object.

It would look something like this:
foreach($subscriptions as $subscription){

3103,74580601,A-Tech,14998487,"There is no specific HTML tag for that.
You need to build these ""accordions"" yourself. The easiest way would be this w3school-tutorial.
There are three parts to it:
HTML
Here you need a button and another div the ""dropdown""-content. W3schools calls it a panel. Preferably, you give both a distinct class. This will make your work easier further down the line.
CSS
Most CSS just makes it look nice, but there are two CSS rules you actually need:
For the button
width: 100%;
You need the full width, so no other elements are next to it and destroy the ""dropdown"" effect when you open the panel
For the panel
display: none;
You want to show the panel only when the button is clicked o, so you need to hide it initially.
JavaScript
You will need to add an event listener (more about events here in the MDN docs) for the click action for each button that has a panel.
If you have a specific class for all button that have a panel, you can just iterate though all of them. For the event listener you define to toggle the active attribute. Then you get the panel next to the button.
let panel = this.nextElementSibling;
For that you switch the CSS rule we defined earlier:
if (panel.style.display === ""none"") {
  panel.style.display = ""block""; // Make it visble
} else {
  panel.style.display = ""none""; // Hide it again
}
});
Here is a shortened version of the w3schools-tutorial code:
var acc = document.getElementsByClassName(""accordion"");
var i;

for (i = 0; i < acc.length; i++) {
  acc[i].addEventListener(""click"", function() {
    this.classList.toggle(""active"");
    var panel = this.nextElementSibling;
    if (panel.style.display === ""block"") {
      panel.style.display = ""none"";
    } else {
      panel.style.display = ""block"";
    }
  });
}

  width: 100%;

  display: none;

    s_ans.ptr_answ = reinterpret_cast<unsigned char*>( &s_desc);                // void pointer also gets the address

Then a recursive sum with skipping non-numbers:

3124,74580565,Daniel T.,506441,"This is not correct.
It has retain cycles. Do not capture self strongly in subscribe when self owns the disposeBag.
Having subscribe calls inside a subscribe call is a code smell. Try to avoid it. (Notice that in the code below, there is only one subscribe(onNext:) instead of many.)
I would rather see code that looks like this:
doTableViewModel.doItems
    .observe(on: MainScheduler.instance)
    .flatMapLatest { [doTableView] items in
        doTableView.configure(viewModelItems: items)
    }
    .subscribe(onNext: { [weak self] action in
        guard let self else { return }
        switch action {
        case let .check(doItem):
            self.tappedDoItemCheck(viewDoItem: doItem)
        case let .edit(doItem):
            self.tappedDoItemEdit(doItem: doItem)
        case let .remove(doItem):
            self.tappedDoItemEdit(doItem: doItem)
        }
    })
    .disposed(by: disposeBag)
To make the above work, you will need to move the other code into DoTableView and DoItemView like this:
extension DoTableView {
    enum Action {
        case check(DoItem)
        case remove(DoItem)
        case edit(DoItem)
    }

    func configure(viewModelItems: [DoItem]) -> Observable<Action> {
        reloadData(viewModelItems: viewModelItems)
        configureLayer()
        return Observable.merge(zip(doItemViews, viewModelItems).map { doItemView, doItem in
            doItemView.configure()
                .compactMap { viewAction in
                    switch viewAction {
                    case .print:
                        print(doItem.doID)
                        return nil
                    case .check:
                        return .check(doItem)
                    case .remove:
                        return .remove(doItem)
                    case .edit:
                        return .edit(doItem)
                    }
                }
        })
    }
}

extension DoItemView {
    enum Action {
        case print
        case check
        case remove
        case edit
    }

    func configure() -> Observable<Action> {
        Observable.merge(
            rx.tapGesture().when(.recognized).map { _ in Action.print },
            checkButton.rx.tapGesture().when(.recognized).map { _ in Action.check },
            deleteButton.rx.tapGesture().when(.recognized).map { _ in Action.remove },
            editButton.rx.tapGesture().when(.recognized).map { _ in Action.edit }
        )
    }
}
Note that with the above code, DoItemView does not need a doItem property any more. That can be removed.
One problem about this that has nothing to do with RxSwift is that it assumes the DoTableView completely destroys and rebuilds its DoItemViews every time the reloadData(viewModelItems:) method is called. That is incredibly inefficient. It would be better to use a normal UITableView or build your DoTableView so that it can reuse DoTableViews like UITableView reuses its cells.",2022-11-26 13:26:38Z,0

3151,3004811,mklement0,45375,"xargs -P <n> allows you to run <n> commands in parallel.
While -P is a nonstandard option, both the GNU (Linux) and macOS/BSD implementations support it.
The following example:
runs at most 3 commands in parallel at a time,
with additional commands starting only when a previously launched process terminates.
time xargs -P 3 -I {} sh -c 'eval ""$1""' - {} <<'EOF'
sleep 1; echo 1
sleep 2; echo 2
sleep 3; echo 3
echo 4
EOF
The output looks something like:
1   # output from 1st command 
4   # output from *last* command, which started as soon as the count dropped below 3
2   # output from 2nd command
3   # output from 3rd command

real    0m3.012s
user    0m0.011s
sys 0m0.008s
The timing shows that the commands were run in parallel (the last command was launched only after the first of the original 3 terminated, but executed very quickly).
The xargs command itself won't return until all commands have finished, but you can execute it in the background by terminating it with control operator & and then using the wait builtin to wait for the entire xargs command to finish.
{
  xargs -P 3 -I {} sh -c 'eval ""$1""' - {} <<'EOF'
sleep 1; echo 1
sleep 2; echo 2
sleep 3; echo 3
echo 4
EOF
} &

# Script execution continues here while `xargs` is running 
# in the background.
echo ""Waiting for commands to finish...""

# Wait for `xargs` to finish, via special variable $!, which contains
# the PID of the most recently started background process.
wait $!
Note:
BSD/macOS xargs requires you to specify the count of commands to run in parallel explicitly, whereas GNU xargs allows you to specify -P 0 to run as many as possible in parallel.
Output from the processes run in parallel arrives as it is being generated, so it will be unpredictably interleaved.
GNU parallel, as mentioned in Ole's answer (does not come standard with most platforms), conveniently serializes (groups) the output on a per-process basis and offers many more advanced features.",2020-06-23 01:52:41Z,28

3158,3004811,Josiah DeWitt,3421482,"Process Spawning Manager
Sure, technically these are processes, and this program should really be called a process spawning manager, but this is only due to the way that BASH works when it forks using the ampersand, it uses the fork() or perhaps clone() system call which clones into a separate memory space, rather than something like pthread_create() which would share memory. If BASH supported the latter, each ""sequence of execution"" would operate just the same and could be termed to be traditional threads whilst gaining a more efficient memory footprint. Functionally however it works the same, though a bit more difficult since GLOBAL variables are not available in each worker clone hence the use of the inter-process communication file and the rudimentary flock semaphore to manage critical sections. Forking from BASH of course is the basic answer here but I feel as if people know that but are really looking to manage what is spawned rather than just fork it and forget it. This demonstrates a way to manage up to 200 instances of forked processes all accessing a single resource. Clearly this is overkill but I enjoyed writing it so I kept on. Increase the size of your terminal accordingly. I hope you find this useful.

For example, on Ubuntu 20.04:
gnome-terminal --tab -- bash -c 'prog1'

To run certain programs or other commands sequentially, you can add ;
gnome-terminal --tab -- bash -c 'prog1_1; prog1_2'
gnome-terminal --tab -- bash -c 'prog2'
I've found that for some programs, the terminal closes before they start up. For these programs I append the terminal command with ; wait or ; sleep 1

       LEFT JOIN bonus_1 b
       ON e.employee_id=b.employee_id
GROUP BY e.employee_id;
Note: do not GROUP BY e.first_name as you will aggregate together people with the same first name; which is almost certainly incorrect.
If you want to modify the bonus_1 table to add a bonus when there are no bonuses for an employee then you want an INSERT statement and not an UPDATE:
INSERT INTO bonus_1 (employee_id, bonus_amount)
SELECT employee_id, 0.2*salary
FROM   employee_1 e
WHERE  NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM bonus_1 b WHERE b.employee_id = e.employee_id);
Or a MERGE ... WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT ... statement:
MERGE INTO bonus_1 b
USING employee_1 e
ON (b.employee_id = e.employee_id)
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
  INSERT (employee_id, bonus_amount)
  VALUES (e.employee_id, 0.2*e.salary);
Note: your title states a 2% bonus, if that is the case then 0.02 = 2% whereas 0.2 = 20%.
Once you have performed the insert then:
SELECT MAX(e.first_name) AS first_name,
       sum(b.bonus_amount) as bon
FROM   employee_1 e
       LEFT JOIN bonus_1 b
       ON e.employee_id=b.employee_id
GROUP BY e.employee_id;
Will have a row for all employees to display the bonuses.

On the backend, overriding the create method of the serializer and loop through resquest.POST.data excluding unwanted keys to access the just the files. And saving them into the Images model (should be named PostImage).
Note that I do no access the validated_data for the files, instead they are retrieved directly from the request.

[f(x) if x is not None else '' for x in xs]
In general,
[f(x) if condition else g(x) for x in sequence]
And, for list comprehensions with if conditions only,
[f(x) for x in sequence if condition]
Note that this actually uses a different language construct, a conditional expression, which itself is not part of the comprehension syntax, while the if after the for…in is part of list comprehensions and used to filter elements from the source iterable.
Conditional expressions can be used in all kinds of situations where you want to choose between two expression values based on some condition. This does the same as the ternary operator ?: that exists in other languages. For example:
value = 123
print(value, 'is', 'even' if value % 2 == 0 else 'odd')",2022-06-06 05:39:16Z,2507
3184,4260280,Tim Skov Jacobsen,5993892,"The specific problem has already been solved in previous answers, so I will address the general idea of using conditionals inside list comprehensions.
Here is an example that shows how conditionals can be written inside a list comprehension:
X = [1.5, 2.3, 4.4, 5.4, 'n', 1.5, 5.1, 'a']     # Original list

# Extract non-strings from X to new list
X_non_str = [el for el in X if not isinstance(el, str)]  # When using only 'if', put 'for' in the beginning

# Change all strings in X to 'b', preserve everything else as is
X_str_changed = ['b' if isinstance(el, str) else el for el in X]  # When using 'if' and 'else', put 'for' in the end
Note that in the first list comprehension for X_non_str, the order is:
expression for item in iterable if condition
and in the last list comprehension for X_str_changed, the order is:
expression1 if condition else expression2 for item in iterable
I always find it hard to remember that expression1 has to be before if and expression2 has to be after else. My head wants both to be either before or after.
I guess it is designed like that because it resembles normal language, e.g. ""I want to stay inside if it rains, else I want to go outside""
In plain English the two types of list comprehensions mentioned above could be stated as:
With only if:
extract_apple for apple in apple_box if apple_is_ripe
and with if/else
mark_apple if apple_is_ripe else leave_it_unmarked for apple in apple_box",2020-06-15 08:33:25Z,81
3185,4260280,Mateen Ulhaq,365102,"Let's use this question to review some concepts. I think it's good to first see the fundamentals so you can extrapolate to different cases.
Other answers provide the specific answer to your question. I'll first give some general context and then I'll answer the question.
Fundamentals
if/else statements in list comprehensions involve two things:
List comprehensions
Conditional expressions (Ternary operators)
1. List comprehensions
They provide a concise way to create lists.
Its structure consists of: ""brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses"".
Case 1
Here we have no condition. Each item from the iterable is added to new_list.
new_list = [expression for item in iterable]
new_list = [x for x in range(1, 10)]
> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Case 2
Here we have one condition.
Example 1
Condition: only even numbers will be added to new_list.
new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]
new_list = [x for x in range(1, 10) if x % 2 == 0]
> [2, 4, 6, 8]
Example 2
Condition: only even numbers that are multiple of 3 will be added to new_list.
new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]
new_list = [x for x in range(1, 10) if x % 2 == 0 if x % 3 == 0]
> [6]
But howcome we have one condition if we use two if in new_list?
The prior expression could be written as:
new_list = [x for x in range(1, 10) if x % 2 and x % 3 == 0]
> [6]
We only use one if statement.
This is like doing:
new_list = []
for x in range(1, 10):
    if x % 2 == 0 and x % 3 == 0:
        new_list.append(x)
> [6]
Example 3
Just for the sake of argument, you can also use or.
Condition: even numbers or numbers multiple of 3 will be added to new_list.
new_list = [x for x in range(1, 10) if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0]
> [2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9]
Case 3
More than one condition:
Here we need the help of conditional expressions (Ternary operators).
2.Conditional Expressions
What are conditional expressions? What the name says: a Python expression that has some condition.
<Exp1> if condition else <Exp2>
First the condition is evaluated. If condition is True, then <Exp1> is evaluated and returned. If condition is False, then <Exp2> is evaluated and returned.
A conditional expression with more than one condition:
<Exp1> if condition else <Exp2> if condition else <Exp3>...    
An example from Real Python:
age = 12
s = 'minor' if age < 21 else 'adult'
> minor
The value of s is conditioned to age value.
3.List Comprehensions with Conditionals
We put list comprehensions and conditionals together like this.
new_list = [<Conditional Expression> for <item> in <iterable>]

new_list = [<Exp1> if condition else <Exp2> if condition else <Exp3> for <item> in <iterable>]
Condition: even numbers will be added as 'even', the number three will be added as 'number three' and the rest will be added as 'odd'.
new_list = ['even' if x % 2 == 0 else 'number three' if x == 3 else 'odd' 
             for x in range(1, 10)]
> ['odd', 'even', 'number three', 'even', 'odd', 'even', 'odd', 'even', 'odd']
The answer to the question
[f(x) for x in xs if x is not None else '']
Here we have a problem with the structure of the list: for x in xs should be at the end of the expression.
Correct way:
[f(x) if x is not None else '' for x in xs]

def change(x):
    if x is None:
        return f(x)
    else:
        return ''

result = [change(x) for x in xs]
Although then you have:
result = map(change, xs)
Or you can use a lambda inline.",2022-06-06 05:41:56Z,49
3187,4260280,Bengt,906658,"Here is another illustrative example:
>>> print("", "".join([""ha"" if i else ""Ha"" for i in range(3)]) + ""!"")
Ha, ha, ha!
It exploits the fact that if i evaluates to False for 0 and to True for all other values generated by the function range(). Therefore the list comprehension evaluates as follows:
>>> [""ha"" if i else ""Ha"" for i in range(3)]
['Ha', 'ha', 'ha']",2013-06-14 17:09:16Z,47

3189,4260280,Mateen Ulhaq,365102,"The other solutions are great for a single if / else construct. However, ternary statements within list comprehensions are arguably difficult to read.
Using a function aids readability, but such a solution is difficult to extend or adapt in a workflow where the mapping is an input. A dictionary can alleviate these concerns:
xs = [None, 'This', 'is', 'a', 'filler', 'test', 'string', None]

d = {None: '', 'filler': 'manipulated'}

res = [d.get(x, x) for x in xs]

print(res)

3190,4260280,arboc7,537258,"It has to do with how the list comprehension is performed.
Keep in mind the following:
[ expression for item in list if conditional ]
Is equivalent to:
for item in list:
    if conditional:
        expression
Where the expression is in a slightly different format (think switching the subject and verb order in a sentence).
Therefore, your code [x+1 for x in l if x >= 45] does this:
for x in l:
    if x >= 45:
        x+1
However, this code [x+1 if x >= 45 else x+5 for x in l] does this (after rearranging the expression):
for x in l:
    if x>=45: x+1
    else: x+5",2019-12-01 17:36:38Z,8
3191,4260280,Peter Mortensen,63550,"Make a list from items in an iterable
It seems best to first generalize all the possible forms rather than giving specific answers to questions. Otherwise, the reader won't know how the answer was determined. Here are a few generalized forms I thought up before I got a headache trying to decide if a final else' clause could be used in the last form.
[expression1(item)                                        for item in iterable]

[expression1(item) if conditional1                        for item in iterable]

[expression1(item) if conditional1 else expression2(item) for item in iterable]

[expression1(item) if conditional1 else expression2(item) for item in iterable if conditional2]
The value of item doesn't need to be used in any of the conditional clauses. A conditional3 can be used as a switch to either add or not add a value to the output list.

3204,1120140,Rolf Kristensen,193178,"When using the Boost Tokenizer escaped_list_separator for CSV files, then one should be aware of the following:
It requires an escape-character (default back-slash - \)
It requires a splitter/seperator-character (default comma - ,)
It requires an quote-character (default quote - "")
The CSV format specified by wiki states that data fields can contain separators in quotes (supported):
1997,Ford,E350,""Super, luxurious truck""
The CSV format specified by wiki states that single quotes should be handled with double-quotes (escaped_list_separator will strip away all quote characters):
1997,Ford,E350,""Super """"luxurious"""" truck""
The CSV format doesn't specify that any back-slash characters should be stripped away (escaped_list_separator will strip away all escape characters).
A possible work-around to fix the default behavior of the boost escaped_list_separator:
First replace all back-slash characters (\) with two back-slash characters (\\) so they are not stripped away.
Secondly replace all double-quotes ("""") with a single back-slash character and a quote (\"")
This work-around has the side-effect that empty data-fields that are represented by a double-quote, will be transformed into a single-quote-token. When iterating through the tokens, then one must check if the token is a single-quote, and treat it like an empty string.
Not pretty but it works, as long there are not newlines within the quotes.",2011-05-24 22:58:04Z,15

I wanted to be able to read in a stream that is known to be in CSV format, and also the types of each field was already known. Of course, the method below could be used to treat every field to be a string type.
As an example of how I wanted to be able to use a CSV input stream, consider the following input (taken from wikipedia's page on CSV):
const char input[] =
""Year,Make,Model,Description,Price\n""
""1997,Ford,E350,\""ac, abs, moon\"",3000.00\n""
""1999,Chevy,\""Venture \""\""Extended Edition\""\""\"",\""\"",4900.00\n""
""1999,Chevy,\""Venture \""\""Extended Edition, Very Large\""\""\"",\""\"",5000.00\n""
""1996,Jeep,Grand Cherokee,\""MUST SELL!\n\
air, moon roof, loaded\"",4799.00\n""
;
Then, I wanted to be able to read in the data like this:
std::istringstream ss(input);
std::string title[5];
int year;
std::string make, model, desc;
float price;
csv_istream(ss)
    >> title[0] >> title[1] >> title[2] >> title[3] >> title[4];
while (csv_istream(ss)
       >> year >> make >> model >> desc >> price) {
    //...do something with the record...

3240,74580472,Mehyar Sawas,5012127,"I suggest to form your question to be: how to update an input value in a component from a sibling component?
Answer
A component itself can not directly change an @Input value in other siblings components.
Here are some ways to do this:
My suggested way
Implement the ControlValueAccessor on your change component to enable the ngModel two way binding on it. And then pass your variable (names) in the two way binding ngModel of your change component, which will take care of changing that value on action and emits the changed value back up to the parent component. That is all you need. Next time the change detection is triggered, the change will apply and your preview component will get the new value through the @Input.
Example:
In your change component:
import { Component, forwardRef} from '@angular/core';
import { ControlValueAccessor, NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-change',
  templateUrl: './change.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./change.component.css'],
  providers: [
    {
      provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,
      useExisting: forwardRef(() => ChangeComponent),
      multi: true,
    },
  ],
})
export class ChangeComponent implements ControlValueAccessor {
  names;
  onChange;
  onTouched;
  
  writeValue(obj: any): void {
    this.names = obj;
  }
  registerOnChange(fn: any): void {
    this.onChange = fn;
  }
  registerOnTouched(fn: any): void {
    this.onTouched = fn;
  }

  changeName() {
    this.names.pop('Test2');
    this.onChange(this.names.slice());
    console.log(this.names);
  }
}
In your parent component template:
<button (click)=""onEnter()"">Set Name</button>

<app-table [names]=""names""> </app-table>

<app-change [(ngModel)]=""names""> </app-change>
This example is very similar to the @Input @Output way to communicate between components, where you change an @Input value between siblings by emitting the new value from the change component up to the parent and the parent will automatically pass the new value the preview component when the angular change detection is triggered.
Here is my stackblitz example
Another way to do this
Provide a service on top of all the siblings and define your value to change in your service and the inject your service in the change sibling and the preview sibling components and change the value directly in the service, this way does not require the the angular @Input decorator.
At the end checkout angular documentation about the components interaction for better understanding.",2022-11-26 09:41:35Z,0

* def data = callonce dataFn

Scenario: one

But you are quite likely to complain here that we are initializing the function dataFn for every Scenario ;) In that case, you may need to look for another framework.

autoincrement – This flag may be set to False to indicate an integer primary key column that should not be considered to be the “autoincrement” column, that is the integer primary key column which generates values implicitly upon INSERT and whose value is usually returned via the DBAPI cursor.lastrowid attribute. It defaults to True to satisfy the common use case of a table with a single integer primary key column.
So, autoincrement is only a flag to let SQLAlchemy know whether it's the primary key you want to increment.

This means that if a Table object defines a Sequence on its primary key column so that it works with Oracle and Firebird, the Sequence would get in the way of the “implicit” sequence that PG would normally use. For this use case, add the flag optional=True to the Sequence object - this indicates that the Sequence should only be used if the database provides no other option for generating primary key identifiers.",2012-05-08 08:51:16Z,20

If other libraries need to use your library, pass said state struct to them via reference or similar

Create a trait describing the desired functionality of your backends.
Create a static Option<dyn BackendTrait> in your library and an initialization function that needs to be called at the beginning of main that sets the desired backend.

That is, the container->containee relationships form an arbitrary directed graph. In fact, it can even be cyclic, so that an object can directly or indirectly contain itself.
However, the DOM elements (those created with createElement) have dual nature.
Firstly, they are normal Javascript objects, and as such, can be added to arbitrary many Javascript containers.
Secondly, they are part of the DOM. Unlike Javascript's arbitrary graph, DOM is a tree, that is, an element can belong to only one DOM container at a time. Once you attach an element to a new DOM container, it is automatically removed from the old one.
Illustration:
let obj = document.createElement('input')

let array1 = []
let array2 = []

// obj is a Javascript object 
// and can live in multiple containers

array1.push(obj)
// now, it's attached to array1

@mkl has given sound advice in his comment, we can see the media is way bigger than the 8 pairs of bars. So currently they occupy 16 pts by 16 points at ground zer0 (Lower Left)
You have several options, the two most obvious are
you can reduce the media
or up scale the image.
Or alter both.
from comments you say pixel to pixel but PDF does not count in pure pixel dpi as we may consider. Let's see you want media to match image that's easy drop media to 16 x 16, however your media location is off which causes default to letter shape media. Lets suggest first step is add the image as greyscale byte stream and put media and crop boxes into the page definition. (Note because of notepad raw text editing I have not checked the xref table so am sure that should be wrong. P.S as requested 4 is in 3 so 5 becomes 4 etc.

At this point you can decide how to upscale the page and or image as relative objects, as per @mkl 's advice.
As it stands image is 0.564444... cm (0.2222..."") so decide on target ratio and upscale to desire.
Lets guess your sample was 5 units up and to the right so let's pad media by 10 units to 42 and double the pixel ratio without adding pixels just their size.
we need to increase media and crop to 42 (however you can drop crop to 5 5 32 32 if you wish)

(#':year 0 4) thus tries to call the function object :year, which does not exist and if it would exist, then it can't be called like this.
Remember: when you want to pass lists as data you have to quote them:
(:year 0 4) this is a list of three items: a keyword symbol and two integer numbers.
If you want to pass that as data you have to quote it:

3327,74580336,Peter Cordes,224132,"Interpreter overhead is normally so high that any savings from less ordering of loads/stores probably wouldn't be very significant. Or even negative savings if you did it like C++ with an optional extra arg to functions like shared_var.load(std::memory_order_relaxed) that the interpreter would have to handle, instead of having separate function names like atomic_relaxed_load(shared_var) vs. atomic_seq_cst_load(shared_var).
Also, most interpreted languages are not designed around multiple threads with the ability to do lock-free atomic operations, since their objects (and thus internal data structures) are higher-level than a machine int.
That's why CPython for example takes/releases the Global Interpreter Lock around each statement, so threading is AFAIK only useful for I/O and stuff like that, where different threads can be blocked on different things. (Or calling a C library function to do some computation or something.) If you want your interpreted language to be able to have multiple threads interpreting at once, you'd have to design the internals from the ground up to make that safe.
(I'd guess there might be some interpreter like that for some language, but I don't remember reading about any of the major mainstream ones like CPython being like that. Even the node.js environment for Javascript which uses the V8 JIT engine doesn't AFAIK support running multiple threads at once. Languages like Java do, though, which is also a VM but was designed to be a bit lower level than Javascript or Python.)",2022-11-26 10:26:26Z,-1

3341,5240789,Jonathan Leffler,15168,"The scanf() function skips leading whitespace automatically before trying to parse conversions other than characters. The character formats (primarily %c; also scan sets %[…] — and %n) are the exception; they don't skip whitespace.
Use "" %c"" with a leading blank to skip optional white space. Do not use a trailing blank in a scanf() format string.
Note that this still doesn't consume any trailing whitespace left in the input stream, not even to the end of a line, so beware of that if also using getchar() or fgets() on the same input stream. We're just getting scanf to skip over whitespace before conversions, like it does for %d and other non-character conversions.
Note that non-whitespace ""directives"" (to use POSIX scanf terminology) other than conversions, like the literal text in scanf(""order = %d"", &order); doesn't skip whitespace either. The literal order has to match the next character to be read.
So you probably want "" order = %d"" there if you want to skip a newline from the previous line but still require a literal match on a fixed string, like this question.",2020-01-12 15:56:37Z,118

3343,5240789,brandizzi,287976,"Another option (that I got from here) is to read and discard the newline by using the assignment-supression option. To do that, we just put a format to read a character with an asterisk between % and c:
scanf(""%d%*c"",&a); // line 1
scanf(""%c%*c"",&c1); // line 3
scanf will then read the next char (that is, the newline) but not assign it to any pointer.
In the end, however, I would second the FAQ's last option:
Or, depending on your requirements, you could also forget about scanf()/getchar(), use fgets() to get a line of text from the user and parse it yourself.",2019-01-27 23:17:20Z,10
3344,5240789,ilkkachu,6372809,"To echo what I have posted in another answer about C++: I suggest to toss scanf() away, to never use it, and to instead use fgets() and sscanf().
The reason for this is, that at least in Unix-like systems by default, the terminal your CLI program runs on does some processing of the user input before your program sees it. It buffers input until a newline is entered, and allows for some rudimentary line editing, like making backspace work.
So, you can never get a single character at a time, or a few single characters, just a full line. But that's not what e.g. scanf(""%d"") processes, instead it processes just the digits, and stops there, leaving the rest buffered in the C library, for a future stdio function to use. If your program has e.g.
printf(""Enter a number: "");
scanf(""%d"", &a);

printf(""Enter a word: "");
scanf(""%s"", word);
and you enter the line 123 abcd, it completes both scanf()s at once, but only after a newline is given. The first scanf() doesn't return when a user has hit space, even though that's where the number ends (because at that point the line is still in the terminal's line buffer); and the second scanf() doesn't wait for you to enter another line (because the input buffer already contains enough to fill the %s conversion).
This isn't what users usually expect!
Instead, they expect that hitting enter completes the input, and if you hit enter, you either get a default value, or an error, with possibly a suggestion to please really just give the answer.
You can't really do that with scanf(""%d""). If the user just hits enter, nothing happens. Because scanf() is still waiting for the number. The terminal sends the line onward, but your program doesn't see it, because scanf() eats it. You don't get a chance to react to the user's mistake.
That's also not very useful.
Hence, I suggest using fgets() or getline() to read a full line of input at a time. This exactly matches what the terminal gives, and always gives your program control after the user has entered a line. What you do with the input line is up to you, if you want a number, you can use atoi(), strtol(), or even sscanf(buf, ""%d"", &a) to parse the number. sscanf() doesn't have the same mismatch as scanf(), because the buffer it reads from is limited in size, and when it ends, it ends -- the function can't wait for more.
(fscanf() on a regular file can also be fine if the file format is one that supports how it skims over newlines like any whitespace. For line-oriented data, I'd still use fgets() and sscanf().)
So, instead of what I had above, use something like this:
printf(""Enter a number: "");

fgets(buf, bufsize, stdin);
sscanf(buf, ""%d"", &a);
or, actually, check the return value of sscanf() too, so you can detect empty lines and otherwise invalid data:
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    const int bufsize = 100;
    char buf[bufsize];
    int a;
    int ret;
    char word[bufsize];

    printf(""Enter a number: "");
    fgets(buf, bufsize, stdin);

    ret = sscanf(buf, ""%d"", &a);

    if (ret != 1) {
        fprintf(stderr, ""Ok, you don't have to.\n"");
        return 1;
    }

    printf(""Enter a word: "");
    fgets(buf, bufsize, stdin);

    ret = sscanf(buf, ""%s"", word);
    if (ret != 1) {
        fprintf(stderr, ""You make me sad.\n"");
        return 1;
    }

    printf(""You entered %d and %s\n"", a, word);
}
Of course, if you want the program to insist, you can create a simple function to loop over the fgets() and sscanf() until the user deigns to do what they're told; or to just exit with an error immediately. Depends on what you think your program should do if the user doesn't want to play ball.
You could do something similar e.g. by looping over getchar() to read characters until a newline after scanf(""%d"") returned, thus clearing up any garbage left in the buffer, but that doesn't do anything about the case where the user just hits enter on an empty line. Anyway, fgets() would read until a newline, so you don't have to do it yourself.",2021-09-23 14:13:32Z,10

The other is using fgets() to instead scanf(). Note: gets() is unsafe, see why gets is dangerous
By contrast, I would prefer to recommend the second way. Because it's more readable and maintainable. For example, in first way, you must think a while before adding/moving some scanf().",2022-09-08 13:47:18Z,0

Here is a flowchart diagram that may help you finding and deciding amongst the various vendors providing a Java 11 implementation.
And a table mapping possible motivations or considerations leading to suggested vendors of Java.
Compatibility concerns
In the Comments, an question was raised, concern over compatibility issues between releases by various vendors.
Firstly, know that the OpenJDK project includes a vast suite of tests known as the OpenJDK Community Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK). Vendors are free to self-declare whether their release has passed those tests. These claims are not verified, and rely on the honor system. On my diagram above, I have check-marked ""TCK"" on the couple vendors I know have self-declared: Oracle JDK by Oracle & Zulu by Azul Systems.
All the products listed in the blue barrel area of my chart above are built almost directly on the OpenJDK source code. So generally, you should see virtually identical compatibility.
There are two areas of concern you might consider: Technology differences, and schedule of updates/patches.
As for technology differences, vendors using the OpenJDK project can ship with either the HotSpot engine or the OpenJ9 engine. These will differ on performance (faster/slower startup versus overall speed, more/less memory), but their behavior in terms of complying with the Java specifications should be identical. They could differ, and certainly either might present a flaw (that likely would be soon fixed) that the other lacked. Personally, I would not be concerned by this, but I mention it for completeness.
Another technology difference is the different kind of JVM used by Zing by Azul Systems and GraalVM by Oracle. Either of these might differ in some way from each other or from the other products, because they intentionally have a different kind of JVM implementation, to offer special features. But given the thoroughness of the Java specs, they should not be incompatible. If they were, you can expect any compatibility problem to be rapidly resolved. If I needed the special features of either of these products, I would use them with full confidence.
Another possible concern is the speed with which a vendor might update their own releases with certain bug fixes or security patches. For example, Oracle has stated that they reserve the right to immediately ship any ready patches to their own customers, while submitting those to the OpenJDK project for consideration. Certainly, any of the vendors providing commercial support are likely to rush a fix or patch to their paying customers. Those releases built as a courtesy to the community provided free-of-cost may take longer to update, likely after the OpenJDK project has incorporated a fix/patch.
And each vendor is free to modify their code base at will, as long as they comply with the Java specs. For example, the Corretto team at Amazon has already made improvements to their own release, and then shared those changes upstream to the OpenJDK project. There may a gap in time before OpenJDK incorporated those changes, if they decide to do so. So it is possible that various releases might differ. But at this point, all of the vendors in the Java community seem to have sincere commitments to work together to prevent fragmentation. So, again, I have no real concern here, but mention this for completeness.",2021-01-22 16:59:34Z,73

3371,33005949,Anand S Kumar,795990,"Like explained in the other answers, the issue is that dictionary comprehension creates a new dictionary, so you don't get reference to that new dictionary until after it has been created. You cannot do dictionary comprehension for what you are doing.
Given that, what you are doing is trying to re-implement what is already done by collections.Counter . You could simply use Counter . Example -
from collections import Counter
term_appearance = Counter()
for x in texts_list:
    term_appearance.update(x)
Demo -
>>> l = [[1,2,3],[2,3,1],[5,4,2],[1,1,3]]
>>> from collections import Counter
>>> term_appearance = Counter()
>>> for x in l:
...     term_appearance.update(x)
...
>>> term_appearance
Counter({1: 4, 2: 3, 3: 3, 4: 1, 5: 1})
If you really want to do this in some kind of comprehension, you can do:
from collections import Counter
term_appearance = Counter()
[term_appearance.update(x) for x in texts_list]
Demo -
>>> l = [[1,2,3],[2,3,1],[5,4,2],[1,1,3]]
>>> from collections import Counter
>>> term_appearance = Counter()
>>> [term_appearance.update(x) for x in l]
[None, None, None, None]
>>> term_appearance
Counter({1: 4, 2: 3, 3: 3, 4: 1, 5: 1})
The output [None, None, None, None] is from the list comprehension resulting in that list (because this was run interactively), if you run this in a script as python <script>, that output would simply be discarded.
You can also use itertools.chain.from_iterable() to create a flattened list from your text_lists and then use that for Counter. Example:
from collections import Counter
from itertools import chain
term_appearance = Counter(chain.from_iterable(texts_list))
Demo -
>>> from collections import Counter
>>> from itertools import chain
>>> term_appearance = Counter(chain.from_iterable(l))
>>> term_appearance
Counter({1: 4, 2: 3, 3: 3, 4: 1, 5: 1})
Also, another issue in your original code in line -
{{term_appearance[l] : term_appearance[l] + 1 if l else term_appearance[l] : 1 for l in x} for x in texts_list}
This is actually a set comprehension with a dictionary comprehension nested inside.
This is the reason you are getting the error - TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict' . Because after first running the dictionary comprehension and creating a dict , it is trying to add that into the set . But dictionaries are not hashable, hence the error.",2015-10-09 01:54:06Z,12

3374,33005949,Community,-1,"Please do look through answer by Anand S Kumar if you want to use collections.Counter which is a great suggestion. However there is another solution related to using collections.defaultdict which I find worth mentioning:
from collections import defaultdict

text_appearances = defaultdict()

for x in texts_lists:
    for l in x:
        text_appearances[l] += 1
I've used this construct some times, and I think is a clean and nice way of doing the count. Especially if you for some reason needs to do some verification in between in the loop, this is an effective way of updating the count directly without worrying whether the key/word already exists in your dictionary (like in your first solution).
Sidenote on variable naming: Please don't use lowercase l (lowercase of L) as a variable name, it is hard to distinguish from 1 (the number one). In your case maybe you could name the variables, words and word? With the addition of not using _list as a postfix, the code could read:
for words in texts:
    for word in words:
        text_appearance[word] += 1",2017-05-23 11:52:17Z,3

3383,74580252,jsejcksn,438273,"The ideal way to solve this problem will depend on the data structures used in the rest of your program: how you store and manipulate the data and what you want to do with it.
Because you haven't shown any code in that regard — and in the interest of demonstrating a solution — I'll store the values in an array in the code snippet demo below: this will give the rest of your program access to the values so that they can be used at any point.
The key concern in your question is to maintain a valid range of values for each ""rating"", no matter how many times a user might click the decrement/increment buttons.
In the approach below, I show using a functional solution that adds the new value to the existing value, and then compare it to the absolute difference, adjusting the result as necessary (see comments).
If anything is still not clear after reviewing the code and comments, feel free to leave a comment on this answer.
// An array of rating states which can be used by other parts of your program:
const ratings = [];

function logRatings () {
  console.log(ratings.map(r => r.value).join(', '));
}

// For example, by this button when it's clicked:
document.getElementById('log-ratings').addEventListener('click', logRatings);

function adjust (rating, amount) {
  // Adjust the value:
  rating.value += amount;

  // If it ends up beyond the specified difference, move it back in range:
  if (Math.abs(rating.value - rating.initialValue) > rating.absoluteDifference) {
    if (rating.value > rating.initialValue) {
      rating.value = rating.initialValue + rating.absoluteDifference;
    }
    else {
      rating.value = rating.initialValue - rating.absoluteDifference;
    }
  }

  return rating.value;
}

// For each rating div:
for (const [index, div] of [...document.querySelectorAll('#container > div.rating')].entries()) {
  const valueSpan = div.querySelector(':scope > span.num');

  // Parse the intial value:
  const initialValue = Number(valueSpan.textContent);
  // Define the desired absolute difference from the initial value:
  const absoluteDifference = 1;

  // Create a rating state for each element group:
  const rating = {
    absoluteDifference,
    initialValue,
    value: initialValue,
  };

  // Add the rating state to the array:
  ratings[index] = rating;

  const btnDown = div.querySelector(':scope > button.countDown');
  const btnUp = div.querySelector(':scope > button.countUp');

  // Disable each corresponding button when the rating reaches the limit,
  // otherwise re-enable it:
  const updateButtons = () => {
    if (Math.abs(rating.value - rating.initialValue) === rating.absoluteDifference) {
      if (rating.value > rating.initialValue) {
        btnUp.disabled = true;
        btnDown.disabled = false;
      }
      else if (rating.value < rating.initialValue) {
        btnUp.disabled = false;
        btnDown.disabled = true;

Typescript may be smart enough to see that in this particular case, value1 is explicitly assigned the value 'POST' and so it can safely assign it to copiedValue regardless, but that would just be a convenience it's giving you since the value is known at compile time.
Yes I think you're right that it's not able to do that in the case of value2 because there's ambiguity there as to whether 'POST' should be considered type 'POST' or type string.
Generally, typing anything 'EXPLICIT STRING HERE' | string is going to give you these kinds of problems. I would say in (nearly?) every case, you want to enumerate all possible string values or type something as string, but not both.",2022-11-26 07:01:18Z,1
3396,74580238,Simon Jacobs,10928439,"is not it a problem that value1 variable has boolean and numeric types set on it too?
In general, yes it is.
However, in your case you have assigned 'POST' to value1. This allows the compiler to infer that, at that point in the program, until something else is done with value1, it is of type 'POST'. With the type so inferred, assignment to copiedValue is permissible.
Try initialising value1 with value false and you will see that you get an error.
Also, if TS compiler allows value1 because it knows that this variable holds ""POST"" at the moment of assignment to copiedValue variable, what is a problem with value2 variable if it also holds absolutely the same ""POST"" value?
In the case of value2, the added type string means that, under the rules of the compiler, it cannot be determined whether value2 is of type 'POST' or string at the relevant point in the code. The compiler would not appear to be sophisticated enough to do that.
For the compiler to do that it would require it checking that no manipulation of the string contents of the value of value2 had not been done (eg to add a character to turn its value from 'POST' into 'POSTS'). It's easy to imagine that adding such a feature is not a priority of the TypeScript team.",2022-11-26 07:18:00Z,1

Google Cloud offers IAM, which lets you assign granular access to specific Google Cloud resources and prevents unwanted access to other resources. IAM lets you control who (users) has what access (roles) to which resources by setting IAM policies on the resources.
You can set an IAM policy at the organization level, the folder level, the project level, or (in some cases) the resource level. Resources inherit the policies of the parent resource. If you set a policy at the organization level, it is inherited by all its child folders and project resources, and if you set a policy at the project level, it is inherited by all its child resources.
The effective policy for a resource is the union of the policy set on the resource and the policy inherited from its ancestors. This inheritance is transitive. In other words, resources inherit policies from the project, which inherit policies from the organization resource. Therefore, the organization-level policies also apply at the resource level.

fun <T> compareBy(
    vararg selectors: (T) -> Comparable<*>?
): Comparator<T>
Creates a comparator using the sequence of functions to calculate a result of comparison. The functions are called sequentially, receive the given values a and b and return Comparable objects. As soon as the Comparable instances returned by a function for a and b values do not compare as equal, the result of that comparison is returned from the Comparator.
And also the info for Comparator which is what that function is ultimately producing:
abstract fun compare(a: T, b: T): Int
So what's basically happening is, a Comparator has a compare function which takes two values that it's going to compare - these are named a and b. They're probably the parameters you're seeing in the debugger, when the comparison is actually running.
The compareBy function on the other hand, takes one or more selector functions which transform each item you want to compare into some value for comparison.
compareBy(
    { it.length }
}
That one's fairly simple - that function is run on every item to produce a length value. That is what gets passed into the compare function, the value returned for two of the items, and those two values are called a and b in the comparison.
So the functions you provide to compareBy act on one item. They just transform an item into a value for comparison purposes - or, if you provide multiple functions, they transform an item into several values for several comparison steps. You're not doing any actual comparison here, so there's no concept of another item, a and b. Just different representations of a single item.
So in your example, each item is a 2-element array, right? That's just a single item, and you just need to transform it into a value for comparison - in this case, a distance.
// skipping the parentheses since it's one selector function
compareBy { myArray ->
    // evaluate to the value we want to ""return""
    val x = myArray[0]
    val y = myArray[1]
    // I think this is what you meant? This gives you distance-squared
    (x * x) + (y * y)
}
This gives you a Comparator that, for whatever items you give its compare function, calculates the distance-squared for each and compares them based on that. That's where the a and b come into it - comparing separate items, and at that part you're not involved. The work you do is setting up how to see an item that's being compared and then feeding a bunch of items into it and letting it run",2022-11-26 17:50:33Z,0

lenema is an input which is an int. Its value will be constant.
Therefore, comparing it with its previous value does not make any sense. Its value will always be the same. And this is the reason why you are not seeing any plots when you change lenema <= lenema[1] to lenema < lenema[1]. Because 200 <= 200 is true but 200 < 200 is not.

while ((temp->x < new_node->x) && (temp != NULL))
The condition temp->x < new_node->x is evaluated before temp != NULL. But, if temp is null, the first comparison will fail on most systems because accessing via a null pointer is undefined behaviour and normally causes a segmentation fault.
By contrast, when you write:
while ((temp != NULL) && (temp->x < new_node->x)) 
The code first checks for the null pointer, and if the pointer is null, does not evaluate the RHS condition, so the crash is averted.
The moral is always to check for null pointers before trying to access data through the pointer. Obviously, if the pointer cannot be null, there is no need to test it before using it. Sometimes, if the pointer should never be null, it may be beneficial to assert that the pointer is not null:

I.e. local variable seen in the method would vanish when the method terminates, but the Predicate would hold the reference to this object to it, so the Set alive until the predicate is alive.
But usually filter method will be executed for each items in list.
And it would be called only once. Each stream element would be checked against the instance of Predicate returned by checkMethod() using Predicate.test().
In other words, method test() would be invoked on the predicate for every element in the stream, but invocation of checkMethod() would occur only one and each element would be checked against the same predicate.

If you have run npm audit and got vulnerabilities, then you can have different scenarios:
Security vulnerabilities found with suggested updates
Run the npm audit fix subcommand to automatically install compatible updates to vulnerable dependencies.
Run the recommended commands individually to install updates to vulnerable dependencies. (Some updates may be semver-breaking changes; for more information, see ""SEMVER warnings"".)
Security vulnerabilities found requiring manual review
If security vulnerabilities are found, but no patches are available, the audit report will provide information about the vulnerability so you can investigate further.
You can read more about it here.
Even after running npm audit fix if it is not fixed, then you can Turn off npm audit. Use the below command to turn off the npm audit.
When installing a single package:
npm install example-package-name --no-audit
To turn off npm audit when installing all packages:
npm set audit false

  runApp(
    MyApp(),

 Navigator.pushNamed(
  context,
 '/user_profile',
 arguments: {""name"" : ""yourName""},);
and this code is for getting the arguments that you've passed in your User_Profile :
var arguments = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as Map;
var name = arguments['name'] as String;

Besides the -i option of sed you can use the tee utility.
From man:
tee - read from standard input and write to standard output and files
So, the solution would be:
sed s/STRING_TO_REPLACE/STRING_TO_REPLACE_IT/g index.html | tee | tee index.html
-- here the tee is repeated to make sure that the pipeline is buffered. Then all commands in the pipeline are blocked until they get some input to work on. Each command in the pipeline starts when the upstream commands have written 1 buffer of bytes (the size is defined somewhere) to the input of the command. So the last command tee index.html, which opens the file for writing and therefore empties it, runs after the upstream pipeline has finished and the output is in the buffer within the pipeline.
Most likely the following won't work:

sed 'code' file > file
is that file is truncated by the shell before sed actually gets to process it. As a result, you get an empty file.
The sed way to do this is to use -i to edit in place, as other answers suggested. However, this is not always what you want. -i will create a temporary file that will then be used to replace the original file. This is problematic if your original file was a link (the link will be replaced by a regular file). If you need to preserve links, you can use a temporary variable to store the output of sed before writing it back to the file, like this:
tmp=$(sed 'code' file); echo -n ""$tmp"" > file
Better yet, use printf instead of echo since echo is likely to process \\ as \ in some shells (e.g. dash):

Spend some time improving your code comments. This will not only help people trying to read your code, but it will get you thinking about it as well, and you will likely find the problem. For example, what do R0-R6 represent? Currently, you only document a few of them, and it's unclear if you're using them properly. Your current in-code comments don't really help -- ""And write the result back to R6"" is not a useful comment. The code itself usually documents what it is doing (unless you're being tricky); good comments explain why you are doing something. When writing assembly-language, I always find it useful to write the code in a higher-level language (say, something like python) first. This not only lets you validate that the algorithm is correct (you can run the code!), but that code then becomes the general code comments for your assembly-language code, as well as a skeleton for creating that code.
Run the program with several different values for R0 and make a table of the results. Is there a pattern to the error? Is it constant or related in some way to R0? This may give you a clue as to what the error is.
Try single-stepping through your program in order to find out where things are going wrong. The CPU emulator has a breakpoint feature that will let you stop and examine your state at any point in the code, this is handy for checking state each time through the loop.

it indicates something special is going on

3584,74579938,Dean Johnson,6324364,"There is nothing that will allow you to extend the lifetime of a reference like you want. A reference does not give you that. Pointers are how we share and transfer ownership because it is only through a pointer that we can take on responsibility of deleting an object.
When we accept a reference as a parameter, we are communicating that we are not accepting any responsibility for the lifetime of the parameter.
With pointers, we have three options and different semantics for each:
Raw pointers. Here, it is unspecified who is responsible for the object. If you follow the general guidance, raw pointers should only be used when we are indicating that we are not taking on any responsibility for the lifetime of the object. Rather than relying on convention we can use one of the other options.
Unique pointers. With unique_ptr parameters we indicate that we are taking ownership of an object from elsewhere. Ownership is transferred to the function and nothing outside of the function owns it.
Shared pointer. Here we are indicating that we are taking on shared responsibility. If we are the last ones to hold the shared_ptr, we will delete it. If we are not the last one, we will not delete it.
All three of these pointer options give us tools for deleting the object. References are used to liberate us from any need to be responsible for deletion. In your case, you want a Bar to extend the lifetime of a Foo. This means you must address the deletion problem in some way. You do that with pointers.
Regarding having to check for validity - yes. Pointers give us the power of deletion. Because it can be deleted, it can also be invalid. References do not give us the power of deletion and thus they should always be valid. If you want the power of deletion (which you do in your example), you have to check for validity.
There is a huge caveat to all of this. You can always turn a reference into a pointer and vice-versa. A pointer and a reference are the same thing in the end, but we use them to communicate different things in our code and trying to break these conventions will generally not make your life easier.
I'll also add that your function baz is not indicating any problem with references. You created foo4 on the stack. Creating something on the stack also means it will be destroyed when the stack is popped. The fact that you are using a reference in Bar is irrelevant. If you used a pointer, you would have the same issue. If you want a Foo to last and have a reference or pointer remain valid, it must be allocated somewhere that remains valid for the duration of its usage (heap, higher level stack frame, global memory, etc.).",2022-11-26 07:46:28Z,1

In C++ you can't do it this way, you need creating objects out of function's scope, in dynamic or global memory, and point to them. So please consider use pointers (all types of them), to achieve what you'd like.
Alternatively, if you pass ownership of a Foo object to a Bar object, it will survive function finishing. But it wouldn't be a reference in this case. You need to either move or copy an object.
You can pass references if you're ready to control lifetime of objects (organize the code the way allowing you clearly understand when object is created and when it will be destroyed).

Further to that, the shoot method doesn't actually do what I expected it would. It doesn't actually shoot but rather just moves the bullet tot he right.

It seems to me that this is the sort of code you end up with when you write it without actually knowing what it's supposed to do.

    if (contains_duplicates(randcode, tempNumber, i) == false) {

contains_duplicates function would look like this:

//array
// contains duplicates; otherwise, it returns false.
{
    for (int j = 0; j <= currentArrSize; j++) {

3661,74579779,Astrid E.,17213526,"For the very basic use cases you have provided, you could achieve the 'interpretation' by looping through your source string, keeping track of which nested level you are currently in (if any), and using a StringBuilder to build your interpreted parts character by character.
You could implement a method containing the following logic:
Create an empty StringBuilder object, which will hold the part of the source string you are currently interpreting
Create a counter to keep track of which nested level you are currently on (starting at 0 -- no nested level)
Loop through your source string, character by character. For each character:
Check whether the character is a space, and whether you are currently inside a nested part or not.
If the character is a space and you are not currently inside a nested part, it means you have reaced the end of the part that is currently being interpreted. Create a string of your StringBuilder object, return it and clear the StringBuilder object to prepare for the next part to be interpreted. Continue to the next character in the source string (i.e. skip the subsequent steps for the current character).
Check whether the current character is an opening inner delimiter ( '(' ). If it is, it means that you are entering the next nested level. Update your nested level counter to reflect that.
If the current character was not an opening inner delimiter; check whether it is a closing inner delimiter ( ')' ). If it is, update your nested level counter to reflect that.
Append the current character to your StringBuilder object.
After having looped through the whole source string, make sure to return the current content of your StringBuilder object as a string. (Unless your source string ends with a space character, the StringBuilder object will at this point contain the final interpreted part.)
Here is a possible implementation:
private static IEnumerable<string> GetInterpretation(string source)
{
    var delimiter = ' ';
    var innerDelimiter = (Opening: '(', Closing: ')');
    
    StringBuilder currentPart = new StringBuilder();
    
    var innerLevel = 0;
    
    Func<bool> isInnerPart = () => innerLevel > 0;
    
    foreach (var ch in source)
    {
        if (ch == delimiter && !isInnerPart())
        {
            yield return currentPart.ToString();
            
            currentPart.Clear();
            
            continue;
        }
        
        if (ch == innerDelimiter.Opening)
        {
            innerLevel++;
        }
        else if (ch == innerDelimiter.Closing)
        {
            innerLevel--;
        }
        
        currentPart.Append(ch);
    }
    
    if (currentPart.Length > 0)
    {
        yield return currentPart.ToString();
    }
}
If your input string variable is named source, you can use the method as follows:
var interpretation = GetInterpretation(source).ToArray();
For the given inputs, the resulting output is:
var source = ""multiply (add 5 5) 5"";
multiply
(add 5 5)
5
var source = ""multiply (add (add 2 5) 5) 5"";
multiply
(add (add 2 5) 5)
5
Example fiddle here.
Note: As stated, this logic and implementation is naive and can be used for the described simple use case.
It assumes:
you also want to split up words that are separated by only a space
(as opposed to a space in combination with a parenthesis)
--> ""ABC DEF (GHI) JKL MNO"" will be interpreted as ""ABC"", ""DEF"", ""(GHI)"", ""JKL"", ""MNO""
nested parts (wrapped inside ( )) that are on the top 'nesting level' are always preceded and succeeded by a space
--> ""ABC DEF(GHI)JKL MNO"" will hence be interpreted as ""ABC"", ""DEF(GHI)JKL"", ""MNO""",2022-11-26 09:34:25Z,0

There is no value in a Students object that can be accessed with square brackets, which is why you're getting the error 'Students' object is not subscriptable.
Instead, you should be sorting with the attrgetter() method, which accesses a named attribute of the objects.

3674,74579757,ivanatias,17195992,"The issue is that Next.js pre-renders pages by default, which means they are rendered on the server first and then sent to the client to be hydrated.
The error comes when you're setting the default value of the state based on this condition: typeof window !== 'undefined'.
Consider the following example:
const Page = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState(typeof window !== 'undefined' ? 'Peter' : 'Rick')
  
  return <h1>{name}</h1>
}

export default Page
This code will throw an error of the type Error: Text content does not match server-rendered HTML.
If you inspect the page's source, you will see that the name rendered on the server was ""Rick"" while on the client-side's first render the name rendered was ""Peter"". There must be a match between the server-side rendered content and the client-side first render's content.
What you can do is move the localStorage data gathering and parsing to another useEffect instead and set the state in there. This solves the issue because useEffect only runs on the client-side, therefore you will effectively match both server-side and client-side first render content.
export default function Page({ data1 }) {
  const [bookmark, setBookmark] = useState([])

  const addToBookmark = (ayatLs) => {
    setBookmark([...bookmark, ayatLs])

3678,74579755,Thorsten Kettner,2270762,"The main point here is that your query is invalid. The DBMS should raise an error, but you work in a cheat mode that MySQL offers that allows you to write such queries without being warned.
My advice: When working in MySQL make sure you have always
SET sql_mode = 'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY';
As to the query: You are using MAX. Thus you aggregate your data. In your GROUP BY clause you say you want one result row per parent_id. You select the parent_id's maximum created_at. You also select the parent_id's ID, the parent_id itself, and the parent_id's amount. The parent_id's ID??? Is there only one ID per parent_id in your table? The amount? Is there only one amount per parent_id in the table? You must tell the DBMS which ID to show and which amount. You haven't done so, and this makes your query invalid according to standard SQL.
You are running MySQL in cheat mode,however, and so MySQL silently applies ANY_VALUE to all non-aggregated columns. This is what your query is turned into internally:
select
  any_value(id),
  parent_id,
  any_value(amount),
  max(created_at)
from table
group by parent_id;
ANY_VALUE means the DBMS is free to pick the attribute from whatever row it likes; you don't care.
What you want instead is not to aggregate your rows, but to filter them. You want to select only those rows with the maximum created_at per parent_id.
There exist several ways to get this result. Here are some options.
Get the maximum created_at per parent_id. Then select the matching rows:
select *
from table 
where (parent_id, created_at) in
(
  select parent_id, max(created_at)
  from table
  group by parent_id
);
Select the rows for which no newer created_at exists for the parent_id:
select *
from table t
where not exists
(
  select null
  from table newer
  where newer.parent_id = t.parent_id
  and newer.created_at > t.created_at
);
Get the maximum created_at on-the-fly. Then compare the dates:
select id, parent_id, amount, created_at
from
(
  select t.*, max(created_at) over (partition by parent_id) as max_created_at
  from table t

Note: Despite the fact that there are numerous ways to improve the existing code, I will try to stick to the original solution since the point is to gain experience through practice (based on the comments). However I will share some tips at the end.
So we can think of it in two steps:
We need some way to make another RingTipShape at the same (centered) position as our existing but a bit larger.
We need to find a way to create a mask that removes only that shape from other content (in our case the track rings)
The first point is an easy one, we just need to define the outer thickness in order to place the ellipse on top of the track at the correct location:
struct RingTipShape: Shape { // small circle
    //...
    let outerThickness: CGFloat
    //...
    let controlRadius: CGFloat = rect.width / 2 - outerThickness / 2
    //...
}
then our existing code changes to:
RingTipShape(currentPercentage: percentage, thickness: 5.5, outerThickness: 5.5)
now for the second part we need something to create a larger circle, which is easy:
RingTipShape(currentPercentage: percentage, thickness: 10.0, outerThickness: 5.5)
ok so now for the final part, we are going to use this (larger) shape to create a kind of inverted mask:
private var thumbMask: some View {
    ZStack {
        Color.white // This part will be transparent
        RingTipShape(currentPercentage: percentage, thickness: 10.0, outerThickness: 5.5)
            .fill(Color.black) // This will be masked out
            .rotationEffect(Angle(degrees: 150))
    }
    .compositingGroup() // Rasterize the shape
    .luminanceToAlpha() // Map luminance to alpha values
}
and we apply the mask like this:
RingShape(currentPercentage: percentage, thickness: 5.5)
    .rotationEffect(Angle(degrees: 150))
    .foregroundColor(.white.opacity(0.385))
    .mask(thumbMask)
which results to this:
Some observations/tips:
You don't need the GeometryReader (and all the frame modifiers) in your CircularWidgetView, the ZStack will offer all available space to views.
You can add .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit) to your image in order to avoid stretching.
You could take advantage of existing apis for making your track shapes.
For example:
struct MyGauge: View {

    let value: Double = 0.5
    let range = 0.1...0.9

    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            // Backing track
            track().opacity(0.2)

            // Value track
            track(showsProgress: true)
        }
    }

    private var mappedValue: Double {
        (range.upperBound + range.lowerBound) * value
    }

    private func track(showsProgress: Bool = false) -> some View {
        Circle()
            .trim(from: range.lowerBound, to: showsProgress ? mappedValue : range.upperBound)
            .stroke(.white, style: .init(lineWidth: 5.5, lineCap: .round))
            .rotationEffect(.radians(Double.pi / 2))
    }
}
would result to:
which simplifies things a bit by utilizing the trim modifier.
I hope that this makes sense.",2022-11-27 08:52:03Z,3

You neglected to wait for the executor service to complete its work.
You ignored all the boilerplate code given to you in the shutdownAndAwaitTermination method shown in the Javadoc for ExecutorService.
Add a call to that boilerplate after you submit your Runnable objects. Now your main thread will wait for the executor’s thread(s) to finish their tasks.
executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
System.out.println(""Begin"");
executorService.execute(runnable1);

Your main thread will keep going, unless you somehow wait on the main thread for the tasks to complete (for example, by invoking executorService.shutdown() and then awaitTermination(...) to wait for the existing jobs to finish).

So If you wish to extract each LINE as it is displayed, by far the simplest way is to use a library such as pdftotext that especially outputs each row of text as seen on page.
Thus using an attack such as tabular comma separated you can expect each AM will be given its own row. Which should by logic be "" "",AM,"" "","" "" but some extractors should say nan,AM,nan,nan
As text it looks like this from just one programmable line
pdftotext -layout ""Battery Voltage.pdf""

testmyvar

As you can see, when executing a command with sudo, you don't preserve all of your environment variables.
There is luckily quite an easy fix for that: use sudo -E (that does preserve environment variables, you can find that option in the man page of sudo)

That's used to create the EC2 instance, because to declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template need use this syntax in your JSON file:
{

  ""Properties"" : {
      ""AutomaticStopTimeMinutes"" : Integer,

}
Then, to choose an AMI for the instance, you must specify a valid 'AMI alias' or a valid AWS Systems Manager path, the default AMI is used if the parameter isn't explicitly assigned a value in the request.

Sure. It is just a conventional character to both of those matching systems.

3753,74579603,Margaret Bloom,5801661,"GCC seems to follow the ABI linked in this answer.
That ABI mandates:
The stack pointer must be adjusted to allocate the stack frame before any other use of the stack pointer register.
A function allocates a stack frame by subtracting the size of the stack frame from $sp on entry to the function. This $sp adjustment must occur before $sp is used within the function and prior to any jump or branch instructions.
So it's not possible to implement the frame pointer as depicted in the book, which would require a move $fp, $sp and then an addiu $sp, $sp, XX.
So the code generated by GCC (without optimizations) according to this ABI has an fp below the frame.
The ABI also mandates a homing/shadow area: even though the first four args are not passed on the stack, the caller must always reserve the corresponding space on the stack so that the callee can save the arg registers on that space.
You can see this behavior by looking at the instruction sw $4,24($fp) and noting that $fp + 24 = original $sp = just above the allocated frame.
This means that even non-leaf functions (functions that call other functions) will generally have $sp = $fp because the compiler knows how much space it needs.
But you can create cases where this is not true, for example by using the infamous alloca:
#include <alloca.h>

int bar(int, int, int, int, int);

int func(int g) {
    int f = 9;
    void* h = alloca(g);
    return bar(f, f, f, f, f);
}
This code is compiled (without optimizations) to:
func:
        addiu   $sp,$sp,-48 #Reserve space for the frame
        sw      $31,44($sp) #Save ra in the highest slot
        sw      $fp,40($sp) #Save fp in the slow below
        move    $fp,$sp     #Set the frame pointer
        
        sw      $4,48($fp)  #Spill the first arg (g) in the homing space
        li      $2,9               
        sw      $2,32($fp)  #f = 9
        
        lw      $2,48($fp)  #g
        nop
        addiu   $2,$2,7
        srl     $2,$2,3
        sll     $2,$2,3     #(g + 7) / 8 * 8 = g aligned on a multiple of 8 (required by the ABI)
        
        subu    $sp,$sp,$2  #alloc g (aligned) bytes on the stack
        
        addiu   $2,$sp,24   #Make a pointer 24 bytes ABOVE the new stack pointer
                    #So there still are 16 byte (homing space) + 4 byte (5th arg to bar) + 4 bytes (alignment)
                    #free just above the stack pointer
                    #Note: we can steal this space from the g bytes allocated because there was a corresponding
                    #space in the frame initially allocated
        addiu   $2,$2,7
        srl     $2,$2,3
        sll     $2,$2,3     #Align this pointer to 8 bytes
        sw      $2,36($fp)  #h = that pointer
        
        lw      $2,32($fp)  #f
        nop
        sw      $2,16($sp)  #Note f is stored relative to SP
        lw      $7,32($fp)
        lw      $6,32($fp)
        lw      $5,32($fp)
        lw      $4,32($fp)  #args
        jal     bar     #call bar
        nop

        move    $sp,$fp     #Restore the stack pointer just below the frame
        lw      $31,44($sp)
        lw      $fp,40($sp) #Restore the regs
        addiu   $sp,$sp,48  #Restore the stack pointer 
        jr      $31
        nop
It may be worth drawing the state of the stack to better understand what's going on.
In general, the frame handling strategy used by the compilers will vary with time and you must take what's written in books with a grain of salt because nobody has the time or possibility to update and republish a book each time a new version of a compiler is released.
Just be sure to understand how the examples in the book work and you'll be able to adapt to new conventions pretty easily.",2022-11-26 13:05:32Z,3

Also, System.in.read(); is a blocking call. This means that you will wait for user input but will be unable to print the '...'. Instead I recommend your read the documentation for input stream, there you will find the .read() function but also the .available() function which will let you know if any characters have been entered in the input buffer.

According to the official doc about the rfft function:
""Multidimensional FFT of a real array A, exploiting the fact that the transform has conjugate symmetry in order to save roughly half the computational time and storage costs compared with fft. If A has size (n_1, ..., n_d), the result has size (div(n_1,2)+1, ..., n_d).""
It's also possible to first create a random nxn matrix with the eltype of ComplexF64 and perform the fft on it; For this create the rnd variable like rand(ComplexF64, n, n) in the above let block, and replace the rfft with fft function.",2022-11-26 06:04:48Z,3

Now, about the other fields, the look odd as you have defined them, and it's likely that it will not work the way you are showing here.
Default would be a value, not a func() (a function that doesn't return anything). You don't know what type the value is, so the type should be interface {} or any (since Go 1.18 - an alias for interface {}).
Transform - that would likely be a function that takes a value, transforms it, and returns a value - func(interface{}) interface{}

3773,74579568,MohitGanorkar,18170152,"First of all, to interact with blob storage you will need a the Azure.Storage.Blobs nuget package.
To interact with the blob storage, you will need a connection string for authentication. This will be available in the Access Keys tab in the portal. Other options for auth such as azure ad and sas tokens are also available
Now you will need a BlobServiceClient , BlobContainerClient and a BlobClient. All three of them basically represent the blob storage, container in which the blobs will be stored and blob itself.
code:
// Refrence to blob storage
        BlobServiceClient client = new BlobServiceClient(""<Your Connection String >"");
        
//Refrence to Container
        BlobContainerClient container = client.GetBlobContainerClient(""< Name of Your Container>"");

// Here I am asuming you already have a container 

// If not it can be created in the portal under the CONTAINERS tab

// Make sure that the PUBLIC ACCESS LEVEL is set to CONTAINER

// Reference to blob

        BlobClient blob = container.GetBlobClient(""< Name Of the BLob>"");
Now using the BlobClient, we can connect to blob storage and upload/download files.
Since your files are in byte array you can upload that also in the blob storage using uploadAsync method and MemoryStream
code:
using (var ms = new MemoryStream(bytearray, false))
        {
            await blob.UploadAsync(ms);
        }
Here we are converting byte array and adding that to blob storage .
Here I have created a console app which will upload a byte array in blob storage.
code :
using Azure.Storage.Blobs;
using static System.Runtime.InteropServices.JavaScript.JSType;


using System;

class Program
{

    
    static public async Task Main(string[] args)
    {

        Console.WriteLine(""Hello World"");
        string conn = """";
       
        BlobServiceClient client = new BlobServiceClient(conn);
    
        BlobContainerClient container = client.GetBlobContainerClient(""test"");

        byte[] bytearray = new byte[2];
        bytearray[0] = 1;
        bytearray[1] = 2;
        
        BlobClient blob = container.GetBlobClient(""testblob"");

        using (var ms = new MemoryStream(bytearray, false))
        {
            await blob.UploadAsync(ms);

Also the index of the last item in an array of size 6 is index 5 so we start there and go until we hit the 0th index and break. also please look into syntax, you must have brackets on a for loop, even if it still compiles no one will like you if they are working with you and it will confuse you.

3792,74579537,chqrlie,4593267,"To adapt your bottom-up iterative mergesort function for non powers of 2 lengths, you will need to special case the last pair of slices at each iteration of the outer loop: stop the inner loop whenever there is fewer elements than 2 full slices and merge the last pair of slices if its right half is not empty.
Here is a modified version of your code:
void mergesort(int key[], int n) {
    int i, j, k;
    int *w = calloc(n, sizeof(*w));  /* allocate workspace   */
    assert(w != NULL);          /* check that calloc() worked */

    for (k = 1; k < n; k *= 2) {
        /* merge all the full pairs */
        for (j = 0; j + 2 * k < n; j += 2 * k) {
            merge(key + j, key + j + k, w + j, k, k);
        }
        if (j + k < n) {
            /* merge the last pair if right half is not empty */
            merge(key + j, key + j + k, w + j, k, n - (j + k));
            j = n;
        }
        /* write merged pairs in w back into key */
        for (i = 0; i < j; i++) {
            key[i] = w[i];
        }
    }
    free(w); /* free the workspace */
}
Note also these remarks:
the above code does not achieve an optimal balance of pair lengths: the merge is still performed on slices whose left part's length is a power of 2.
the merge function (which you cannot modify) should declare a and b as const int * and use a test if (a[i] <= b[j]) for better performance on arrays with many duplicates.
the type size_t should be used for the length and index variables.
the write back loop could be omitted in all but the last phase for better performance, using 2 working pointers.
Here is an improved version:
void mergesort(int key[], int n) {
    int i, j, k;
    int *w = calloc(n, sizeof(*w));  /* allocate workspace   */
    assert(w != NULL);          /* check that calloc() worked */

    int *w1 = key;
    int *w2 = w;
    int *w3;

        /* merge all the full pairs */
        for (j = 0; j + 2 * k < n; j += 2 * k) {
            merge(w1 + j, w1 + j + k, w2 + j, k, k);
        }
        if (j + k < n) {
            /* merge the last pair if right half is not empty */
            merge(w1 + j, w1 + j + k, w2 + j, k, n - (j + k));

3793,74579537,Clement Faisandier,20603928,"I think the reason your prof says things don't work as intended is your merge function.
You call merge(key + j, key + j + k, w + j, k, k);. Here you assume that the two arrays you are merging contain k elements. This is not the case, with 15 elements in the array when k=2 and j=12 you need two merge two sorted arrays of length 2 and 1 respectively. Therefore your code is prone to an overflow.
Therefore your call should be: merge(key + j, key + j + k, w + j, k, k-((n-j)/2)) Now this may depend on your compiler but the division should floor down to 1 instead of 1.5.
Another note I'd like to make:
Code doesn't exist in a vacuum. People will use, and more importantly read your code.
Although your code makes sense, do make an effort to keep it readable. Lines such as: c[k++] = a[i++]; make use of hyper specific nuances around C that probably don't translate well to other platforms. Although the code is technically correct, other programmers will have a harder time to decrypt your syntax and interpret the logic of your program. If you added the additions as part of the write for performance reason, know that the compiler is far better than you are at making efficient code. Leave efficiency to the compiler, most people who write ""efficient code"" write unreadable code that the compiler writes better anyways.
This may seem trivial for such a program of less than 100 lines of code, but in the future you will definitely be turning in assignments with 300+ lines of code. On top of that the inner-workings of this program will be so much more complicated and vast that your TA/Professor will give up and give you a bad grade.

And for each thing, not only will you want a button, ,but also code that operates on that one row. Again, 9 out of 10 times, you not REALLY wanting JUST a button, but a button along with some information.
And clicking on that button should operate on that ONE thing. In other words, with 10 rows, and 10 buttons, do you want to try and write all that code, and THEN figure out what button you clicked on??? So, really, the problem + solution is to build one thing, drop it on the page, and then “add” a new row to that “thing”, and it will show the button + text, or whatever you want. The huge “bonus” part is now when you click on a row, it can operate on that one row, and the code is all the same for 2 rows, or 20 rows. The above is the “essence” of how asp.net works. This is un-like many other systems (such as the popular PHP – where often you write looping code to repeat information on the screen). So, lets build something that lets us add a new row, and that new row will have a text box, and a button. Heck, lets toss in a radio button list choice – and repeat that too! The cool concept here is that we can drop more controls into that “repeater”, and we don’t have to write really much more code to “repeat” over and over that one thing. And when we click on that button, then we get/have the information about that one row. So, I VERY much doubt ALL you want is a simple button, and no doubt will want to repeat MORE then just a button.
So, to “repeat” things on a web page, then an appropriate choice is a “repeater” (seems to have the right name, don’t you think???).
So, we can now have this really simple markup. Only the button and the text box – and only have to drop that text box and button ONE time onto the page.
We then let asp.net do its magic, and maintain, and allow us to have 2 or 20 rows. And in the future, we can feed this “thing” data from a database (so, when you return to the page, it can remember and display what you have!!). I mean it is VERY unlikely that you going to say have 5 rows, and then tomorrow when you return to the page, everything is gone? Now how you going to re-inject the “rows” that you had? (again, think of this problem not in web + html markup, but as a “thing” you want to repeat over and over, and no doubt want to “save” this information.). So, the REAL challenge is not placing a button on the page, but management of this WHOLE problem in a way that does not break the bank in the amount of code you have to write here. I mean, if you manage to inject 5 rows/5 buttons, then how are you going to manage this 5 sets of whatever it is you want? And how will you return to that page to re-edit, or change or even just display that information again? Just code to inject one button gains and gets you quite much nothing of use here. Ok, so, lets drop in our ONE button, text box, and even for bonus points, drop in a readio button choice.
So, lets drop in a button to “add” the markup, including that button. Below that, we will have the markup we want to repeat (like the button etc.).
So, our button:
        <asp:Button ID=""cmdNew"" runat=""server"" Text=""Add new"" CssClass=""btn""
            OnClick=""cmdNew_Click""
            />
        <br />
        <br />
Ok, that will ""add our button"" (and whatever else we want ALONG with that button!!!).
So, now below above, we have this:
        <asp:Repeater ID=""Repeater1"" runat=""server""  >
            <ItemTemplate>
                <div style=""float: left"">
                    Comic:<br />
                    <asp:TextBox ID=""txtComic"" runat=""server""

                        RepeatDirection=""Horizontal"" CellPadding=""8""

                    </asp:RadioButtonList>
                </div>
                <div style=""clear:both"">

                    Notes:<br />
                    <asp:TextBox ID=""txtComments"" runat=""server""
                        TextMode=""MultiLine"" Height=""119px"" Width=""328px""
                        Text='<%# Eval(""Comments"") %>'
                        ></asp:TextBox>

                    <asp:Button ID=""cmdRow"" runat=""server"" Text=""View"" style=""margin-left:8px""
                        OnClick=""cmdRow_Click"" CssClass=""btn""
                        />
                </div>
                <hr / style=""border:solid 1px"">
                <br />
            </ItemTemplate>

        </asp:Repeater>
Now, we in code create the ""thing"" we want to repeat.
so, this code:
    public class ComicBook
    {
        public string Comic { get; set; }
        public string Rating { get; set; }
        public string Comments { get; set; }
    }


    List<ComicBook> MyComics = new List<ComicBook>();

    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
    }

    protected void cmdNew_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        GetExistingRows();
        ComicBook NewComic = new ComicBook();
        NewComic.Rating = ""Poor"";
        MyComics.Add(NewComic);
        Repeater1.DataSource = MyComics;
        Repeater1.DataBind();
    }

    void GetExistingRows()
    {
        foreach(RepeaterItem OneRow in Repeater1.Items)
        {
            ComicBook OneComic = new ComicBook();
            OneComic.Comic = ((TextBox)OneRow.FindControl(""txtComic"")).Text;
            OneComic.Rating = ((RadioButtonList)OneRow.FindControl(""rRating"")).SelectedItem.Text;
            OneComic.Comments = ((TextBox)OneRow.FindControl(""txtComments"")).Text;
            MyComics.Add(OneComic);
        }

    }

    protected void cmdRow_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Button btn = (Button)sender;
        RepeaterItem rRow = (RepeaterItem)btn.NamingContainer;
        Debug.Print(""Row click = "" + rRow.ItemIndex);
        TextBox txtComic = (TextBox)rRow.FindControl(""txtComic"");
        Debug.Print(""Comic name = ""+ txtComic.Text);
        
    }
Note how there is NOT a bunch of html injection code in above.
so, now when we run, we get this:
but, EVEN better, is note the button click event!!!
When we click that ""view"" button, we now can get information about the ONE row we clicked on.
If I click view on the 2nd set of controls, then output is this:
output:
Row click = 1   (row number is zero based)
Comic name = Spider man
So, now if I add 2 or 8, then note how I don't write more code, I don't have to write loops to inject markup, and I also as huge bonus have a button click wired up that allows operations on the ""repeated"" thing.
So, don't try to inject the button. Design your task/problem based on the concept of ""what"" it is you need/want to repeat.
And it turns out this approach is VERY database friendly, so we could in place of the above (using the page viewstate) use a database for each thing we ""add"", and thus the code to repeat and display information when we return to that page next day is ALSO really quite much already written for us.",2022-11-27 20:13:00Z,0

List<T> offers a lot more functionality than an array (although LINQ evens it up a bit), and is almost always the right choice. Except for params arguments, of course. ;-p
As a counter - List<T> is one-dimensional; where-as you have have rectangular (etc) arrays like int[,] or string[,,] - but there are other ways of modelling such data (if you need) in an object model.

I use a local rolling byte[] buffer which I fill before sending down to the underlying stream (and v.v.); quicker than BufferedStream etc;

An array of exposed-field structures will allow the its elements to be efficiently modified ""in place""--something which is not possible with any other collection type. Because an array of structures holds its elements consecutively in RAM, sequential accesses to array elements can be very fast. In situations where code will need to make many sequential passes through an array, an array of structures may outperform an array or other collection of class object references by a factor of 2:1; further, the ability to update elements in place may allow an array of structures to outperform any other kind of collection of structures.
Although arrays are not resizable, it is not difficult to have code store an array reference along with the number of elements that are in use, and replace the array with a larger one as required. Alternatively, one could easily write code for a type which behaved much like a List<T> but exposed its backing store, thus allowing one to say either MyPoints.Add(nextPoint); or MyPoints.Items[23].X += 5;.

You can check if this is the issue you're having by trying a different image URL that doesn't have characters that need escaping.
You could do this to the data in the component just using Javascripts built in encodeURI() method.

})
export class EncodeUriPipe implements PipeTransform {

I think it's obvious this is for coloring the console text, and in that you have a big issue. The formats that this is going to add to your text is full of numbers. This means that as you go along replacing numbers, you are going to also start replacing chunks of the format that you injected.
The only way around this is with regex. However it becomes more complicated because you need to replace a single character with many characters, which means as the regex is rolling along we need to build a separate string that will be your final data. Getting everything to line up without losing any data is cumbersome.
This is well beyond an example.

JavaScript has lexical (also called static) scoping and closures. This means you can tell the scope of an identifier by looking at the source code.
The four scopes are:
Global - visible by everything
Function - visible within a function (and its sub-functions and blocks)
Block - visible within a block (and its sub-blocks)
Module - visible within a module
Outside of the special cases of global and module scope, variables are declared using var (function scope), let (block scope), and const (block scope). Most other forms of identifier declaration have block scope in strict mode.
Overview
Scope is the region of the codebase over which an identifier is valid.
A lexical environment is a mapping between identifier names and the values associated with them.
Scope is formed of a linked nesting of lexical environments, with each level in the nesting corresponding to a lexical environment of an ancestor execution context.
These linked lexical environments form a scope ""chain"". Identifier resolution is the process of searching along this chain for a matching identifier.
Identifier resolution only occurs in one direction: outwards. In this way, outer lexical environments cannot ""see"" into inner lexical environments.
There are three pertinent factors in deciding the scope of an identifier in JavaScript:
How an identifier was declared
Where an identifier was declared
Whether you are in strict mode or non-strict mode
Some of the ways identifiers can be declared:
var, let and const
Function parameters
Catch block parameter
Function declarations
Named function expressions
Implicitly defined properties on the global object (i.e., missing out var in non-strict mode)
import statements
eval
Some of the locations identifiers can be declared:
Global context
Function body
Ordinary block
The top of a control structure (e.g., loop, if, while, etc.)
Control structure body
Modules
Declaration Styles
var
Identifiers declared using var have function scope, apart from when they are declared directly in the global context, in which case they are added as properties on the global object and have global scope. There are separate rules for their use in eval functions.
let and const
Identifiers declared using let and const have block scope, apart from when they are declared directly in the global context, in which case they have global scope.
Note: let, const and var are all hoisted. This means that their logical position of definition is the top of their enclosing scope (block or function). However, variables declared using let and const cannot be read or assigned to until control has passed the point of declaration in the source code. The interim period is known as the temporal dead zone.
function f() {
    function g() {
        console.log(x)
    }
    let x = 1
    g()
}
f() // 1 because x is hoisted even though declared with `let`!
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Function parameter names
Function parameter names are scoped to the function body. Note that there is a slight complexity to this. Functions declared as default arguments close over the parameter list, and not the body of the function.
Function declarations
Function declarations have block scope in strict mode and function scope in non-strict mode. Note: non-strict mode is a complicated set of emergent rules based on the quirky historical implementations of different browsers.
Named function expressions
Named function expressions are scoped to themselves (e.g., for the purpose of recursion).
Implicitly defined properties on the global object
In non-strict mode, implicitly defined properties on the global object have global scope, because the global object sits at the top of the scope chain. In strict mode, these are not permitted.
eval
In eval strings, variables declared using var will be placed in the current scope, or, if eval is used indirectly, as properties on the global object.
Examples
The following will throw a ReferenceError because the namesx, y, and z have no meaning outside of the function f.
function f() {
    var x = 1
    let y = 1
    const z = 1
}
console.log(typeof x) // undefined (because var has function scope!)
console.log(typeof y) // undefined (because the body of the function is a block)
console.log(typeof z) // undefined (because the body of the function is a block)
Run code snippetExpand snippet
The following will throw a ReferenceError for y and z, but not for x, because the visibility of x is not constrained by the block. Blocks that define the bodies of control structures like if, for, and while, behave similarly.
{
    var x = 1
    let y = 1
    const z = 1
}
console.log(x) // 1
console.log(typeof y) // undefined because `y` has block scope
console.log(typeof z) // undefined because `z` has block scope
Run code snippetExpand snippet
In the following, x is visible outside of the loop because var has function scope:
for(var x = 0; x < 5; ++x) {}
console.log(x) // 5 (note this is outside the loop!)
Run code snippetExpand snippet
...because of this behavior, you need to be careful about closing over variables declared using var in loops. There is only one instance of variable x declared here, and it sits logically outside of the loop.
The following prints 5, five times, and then prints 5 a sixth time for the console.log outside the loop:
for(var x = 0; x < 5; ++x) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(x)) // closes over the `x` which is logically positioned at the top of the enclosing scope, above the loop
}
console.log(x) // note: visible outside the loop
Run code snippetExpand snippet
The following prints undefined because x is block-scoped. The callbacks are run one by one asynchronously. New behavior for let variables means that each anonymous function closed over a different variable named x (unlike it would have done with var), and so integers 0 through 4 are printed.:
for(let x = 0; x < 5; ++x) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(x)) // `let` declarations are re-declared on a per-iteration basis, so the closures capture different variables
}
console.log(typeof x) // undefined
Run code snippetExpand snippet
The following will NOT throw a ReferenceError because the visibility of x is not constrained by the block; it will, however, print undefined because the variable has not been initialised (because of the if statement).
if(false) {
    var x = 1
}
console.log(x) // here, `x` has been declared, but not initialised
Run code snippetExpand snippet
A variable declared at the top of a for loop using let is scoped to the body of the loop:
for(let x = 0; x < 10; ++x) {} 
console.log(typeof x) // undefined, because `x` is block-scoped
Run code snippetExpand snippet
The following will throw a ReferenceError because the visibility of x is constrained by the block:
if(false) {
    let x = 1
}
console.log(typeof x) // undefined, because `x` is block-scoped

Variables declared using var, let or const are all scoped to modules:
// module1.js

var x = 0
export function f() {}

//module2.js

import f from 'module1.js'

console.log(x) // throws ReferenceError
The following will declare a property on the global object because variables declared using var within the global context are added as properties to the global object:
var x = 1
console.log(window.hasOwnProperty('x')) // true
Run code snippetExpand snippet
let and const in the global context do not add properties to the global object, but still have global scope:
let x = 1
console.log(window.hasOwnProperty('x')) // false
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Function parameters can be considered to be declared in the function body:
function f(x) {}
console.log(typeof x) // undefined, because `x` is scoped to the function
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Catch block parameters are scoped to the catch-block body:
try {} catch(e) {}
console.log(typeof e) // undefined, because `e` is scoped to the catch block

Named function expressions are scoped only to the expression itself:
(function foo() { console.log(foo) })()
console.log(typeof foo) // undefined, because `foo` is scoped to its own expression

In non-strict mode, implicitly defined properties on the global object are globally scoped. In strict mode, you get an error.
x = 1 // implicitly defined property on the global object (no ""var""!)

console.log(x) // 1
console.log(window.hasOwnProperty('x')) // true

How it works under the hood
Scope is defined as the lexical region of code over which an identifier is valid.
In JavaScript, every function-object has a hidden [[Environment]] reference that is a reference to the lexical environment of the execution context (stack frame) within which it was created.
When you invoke a function, the hidden [[Call]] method is called. This method creates a new execution context and establishes a link between the new execution context and the lexical environment of the function-object. It does this by copying the [[Environment]] value on the function-object, into an outer reference field on the lexical environment of the new execution context.
Note that this link between the new execution context and the lexical environment of the function object is called a closure.
Thus, in JavaScript, scope is implemented via lexical environments linked together in a ""chain"" by outer references. This chain of lexical environments is called the scope chain, and identifier resolution occurs by searching up the chain for a matching identifier.

3874,500431,krosenvold,23691,"Javascript uses scope chains to establish the scope for a given function. There is typically one global scope, and each function defined has its own nested scope. Any function defined within another function has a local scope which is linked to the outer function. It's always the position in the source that defines the scope.
An element in the scope chain is basically a Map with a pointer to its parent scope.

Traditionally, JavaScript really only has two types of scope :
Global Scope : Variables are known throughout the application, from the start of the application (*)
Functional Scope : Variables are known within the function they are declared in, from the start of the function (*)
I will not elaborate on this, since there are already many other answers explaining the difference.
Modern JavaScript
The most recent JavaScript specs now also allow a third scope :
Block Scope : Identifiers are ""known"" from the top of the scope they are declared within, but they cannot be assigned to or dereferenced (read) until after the line of their declaration. This interim period is called the ""temporal dead zone.""
How do I create block scope variables?
Traditionally, you create your variables like this :
var myVariable = ""Some text"";
Block scope variables are created like this :
let myVariable = ""Some text"";
So what is the difference between functional scope and block scope?
To understand the difference between functional scope and block scope, consider the following code :
// i IS NOT known here
// j IS NOT known here
// k IS known here, but undefined
// l IS NOT known here

function loop(arr) {
    // i IS known here, but undefined
    // j IS NOT known here
    // k IS known here, but has a value only the second time loop is called
    // l IS NOT known here

    for( var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++ ) {
        // i IS known here, and has a value
        // j IS NOT known here
        // k IS known here, but has a value only the second time loop is called
        // l IS NOT known here
    };

    // i IS known here, and has a value
    // j IS NOT known here
    // k IS known here, but has a value only the second time loop is called
    // l IS NOT known here

    for( let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++ ) {
        // i IS known here, and has a value
        // j IS known here, and has a value
        // k IS known here, but has a value only the second time loop is called
        // l IS NOT known here
    };

    // i IS known here, and has a value
    // j IS NOT known here
    // k IS known here, but has a value only the second time loop is called
    // l IS NOT known here
}

loop([1,2,3,4]);

for( var k = 0; k < arr.length; k++ ) {
    // i IS NOT known here
    // j IS NOT known here
    // k IS known here, and has a value
    // l IS NOT known here
};

for( let l = 0; l < arr.length; l++ ) {
    // i IS NOT known here
    // j IS NOT known here
    // k IS known here, and has a value
    // l IS known here, and has a value
};

loop([1,2,3,4]);

// i IS NOT known here
// j IS NOT known here
// k IS known here, and has a value
// l IS NOT known here
Here, we can see that our variable j is only known in the first for loop, but not before and after. Yet, our variable i is known in the entire function.
Also, consider that block scoped variables are not known before they are declared because they are not hoisted. You're also not allowed to redeclare the same block scoped variable within the same block. This makes block scoped variables less error prone than globally or functionally scoped variables, which are hoisted and which do not produce any errors in case of multiple declarations.
Is it safe to use block scope variables today?
Whether or not it is safe to use today, depends on your environment :
If you're writing server-side JavaScript code (Node.js), you can safely use the let statement.
If you're writing client-side JavaScript code and use a browser based transpiler (like Traceur or babel-standalone), you can safely use the let statement, however your code is likely to be anything but optimal with respect to performance.
If you're writing client-side JavaScript code and use a Node based transpiler (like the traceur shell script or Babel), you can safely use the let statement. And because your browser will only know about the transpiled code, performance drawbacks should be limited.
If you're writing client-side JavaScript code and don't use a transpiler, you need to consider browser support.
These are some browsers that don't support let at all :
Internet explorer 10 and below
Firefox 43 and below
Safari 9 and below
Android browser 4 and below
Opera 27 and below
Chome 40 and below
ANY version of Opera Mini & Blackberry Browser
How to keep track of browser support
For an up-to-date overview of which browsers support the let statement at the time of your reading this answer, see this Can I Use page.

3880,500431,Travis J,1026459,"The idea of scoping in JavaScript when originally designed by Brendan Eich came from the HyperCard scripting language HyperTalk.
In this language, the displays were done similar to a stack of index cards. There was a master card referred to as the background. It was transparent and can be seen as the bottom card. Any content on this base card was shared with cards placed on top of it. Each card placed on top had its own content which took precedence over the previous card, but still had access to the prior cards if desired.
This is exactly how the JavaScript scoping system is designed. It just has different names. The cards in JavaScript are known as Execution ContextsECMA. Each one of these contexts contains three main parts. A variable environment, a lexical environment, and a this binding. Going back to the cards reference, the lexical environment contains all of the content from prior cards lower in the stack. The current context is at the top of the stack and any content declared there will be stored in the variable environment. The variable environment will take precedence in the case of naming collisions.
The this binding will point to the containing object. Sometimes scopes or execution contexts change without the containing object changing, such as in a declared function where the containing object may be window or a constructor function.
These execution contexts are created any time control is transferred. Control is transferred when code begins to execute, and this is primarily done from function execution.
So that is the technical explanation. In practice, it is important to remember that in JavaScript
Scopes are technically ""Execution Contexts""
Contexts form a stack of environments where variables are stored
The top of the stack takes precedence (the bottom being the global context)
Each function creates an execution context (but not always a new this binding)
Applying this to one of the previous examples (5. ""Closure"") on this page, it is possible to follow the stack of execution contexts. In this example there are three contexts in the stack. They are defined by the outer context, the context in the immediately invoked function called by var six, and the context in the returned function inside of var six's immediately invoked function.
i) The outer context. It has a variable environment of a = 1
ii) The IIFE context, it has a lexical environment of a = 1, but a variable environment of a = 6 which takes precedence in the stack
iii) The returned function context, it has a lexical environment of a = 6 and that is the value referenced in the alert when called.",2015-09-14 20:29:53Z,28
3881,500431,Gerard ONeill,1331672,"1) There is a global scope, a function scope, and the with and catch scopes. There is no 'block' level scope in general for variable's -- the with and the catch statements add names to their blocks.
2) Scopes are nested by functions all the way to the global scope.
3) Properties are resolved by going through the prototype chain. The with statement brings object property names into the lexical scope defined by the with block.
EDIT: ECMAAScript 6 (Harmony) is spec'ed to support let, and I know chrome allows a 'harmony' flag, so perhaps it does support it..
Let would be a support for block level scoping, but you have to use the keyword to make it happen.
EDIT: Based on Benjamin's pointing out of the with and catch statements in the comments, I've edited the post, and added more. Both the with and the catch statements introduce variables into their respective blocks, and that is a block scope. These variables are aliased to the properties of the objects passed into them.
 //chrome (v8)

 var a = { 'test1':'test1val' }
 test1   // error not defined
 with (a) { var test1 = 'replaced' }
 test1   // undefined
 a       // a.test1 = 'replaced'
EDIT: Clarifying example:
test1 is scoped to the with block, but is aliased to a.test1. 'Var test1' creates a new variable test1 in the upper lexical context (function, or global), unless it is a property of a -- which it is.
Yikes! Be careful using 'with' -- just like var is a noop if the variable is already defined in the function, it is also a noop with respect to names imported from the object! A little heads up on the name already being defined would make this much safer. I personally will never use with because of this.",2014-06-06 17:13:06Z,18
3882,500431,CertainPerformance,9515207,"Inline handlers
A very common issue not described yet that front-end coders often run into is the scope that is visible to an inline event handler in the HTML - for example, with
<button onclick=""foo()""></button>
The scope of the variables that an on* attribute can reference must be either:
global (working inline handlers almost always reference global variables)
a property of the document (eg, querySelector as a standalone variable will point to document.querySelector; rare)
a property of the element the handler is attached to (like above; rare)
Otherwise, you'll get a ReferenceError when the handler is invoked. So, for example, if the inline handler references a function which is defined inside window.onload or $(function() {, the reference will fail, because the inline handler may only reference variables in the global scope, and the function is not global:
Show code snippet
Properties of the document and properties of the element the handler is attached to may also be referenced as standalone variables inside inline handlers because inline handlers are invoked inside of two with blocks, one for the document, one for the element. The scope chain of variables inside these handlers is extremely unintuitive, and a working event handler will probably require a function to be global (and unnecessary global pollution should probably be avoided).
Since the scope chain inside inline handlers is so weird, and since inline handlers require global pollution to work, and since inline handlers sometimes require ugly string escaping when passing arguments, it's probably easier to avoid them. Instead, attach event handlers using Javascript (like with addEventListener), rather than with HTML markup.
Show code snippet
Modules (<script type=""module"">)
On a different note, unlike normal <script> tags, which run on the top level, code inside ES6 modules runs in its own private scope. A variable defined at the top of a normal <script> tag is global, so you can reference it in other <script> tags, like this:
Show code snippet

3887,500431,James Drinkard,543572,"Just to add to the other answers, scope is a look-up list of all the declared identifiers (variables), and enforces a strict set of rules as to how these are accessible to currently executing code. This look-up may be for the purposes of assigning to the variable, which is an LHS (lefthand-side) reference, or it may be for the purposes of retrieving its value, which is an RHS (righthand-side) reference. These look-ups are what the JavaScript engine is doing internally when it's compiling and executing the code.
So from this perspective, I think that a picture would help that I found in the Scopes and Closures ebook by Kyle Simpson:
Quoting from his ebook:
The building represents our program’s nested scope ruleset. The first floor of the building represents your currently executing scope, wherever you are. The top level of the building is the global scope. You resolve LHS and RHS references by looking on your current floor, and if you don’t find it, taking the elevator to the next floor, looking there, then the next, and so on. Once you get to the top floor (the global scope), you either find what you’re looking for, or you don’t. But you have to stop regardless.
One thing of note that is worth mentioning, ""Scope look-up stops once it finds the first match"".
This idea of ""scope levels"" explains why ""this"" can be changed with a newly created scope, if it's being looked up in a nested function. Here is a link that goes into all these details, Everything you wanted to know about javascript scope",2016-03-30 13:33:04Z,9
3888,500431,jackbean818,1229135,"There are ALMOST only two types of JavaScript scopes:
the scope of each var declaration is associated with the most immediately enclosing function
if there is no enclosing function for a var declaration, it is global scope
So, any blocks other than functions do not create a new scope. That explains why for-loops overwrite outer scoped variables:
var i = 10, v = 10;
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) { var v = 5; }
console.log(i, v);
// output 5 5
Using functions instead:
var i = 10, v = 10;
$.each([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], function(i) { var v = 5; });
console.log(i,v);
// output 10 10
In the first example, there was no block scope, so the initially declared variables were overwritten. In the second example, there was a new scope due to the function, so the initially declared variables were SHADOWED, and not overwritten.
That's almost all you need to know in terms of JavaScript scoping, except:
try/catch introduce new scope ONLY for the exception variable itself, other variables do not have new scope
with-clause apparently is another exception, but using with-clause it highly discouraged (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/with)
So you can see JavaScript scoping is actually extremely simple, albeit not always intuitive. A few things to be aware of:
var declarations are hoisted to the top of the scope. This means no matter where the var declaration happens, to the compiler it is as if the var itself happens at the top
multiple var declarations within the same scope are combined
So this code:
var i = 1;
function abc() {
  i = 2;
  var i = 3;
}
console.log(i);     // outputs 1
is equivalent to:
var i = 1;
function abc() {
  var i;     // var declaration moved to the top of the scope
  i = 2;
  i = 3;     // the assignment stays where it is
}
console.log(i);

const should be used for 95% of cases. It makes it so the variable reference can't change. Array, object, and DOM node properties can change and should likely be const.
let should be be used for any variable expecting to be reassigned. This includes within a for loop. If you ever change value beyond initialization, use let.

3894,500431,HoldOffHunger,2430549,"ES5 and earlier:
Variables in Javascript were initially (pre ES6) lexically function scoped. The term lexically scoped means that you can see the scope of the variables by 'looking' at the code.
Every variable declared with the var keyword is scoped to the function. However, if other function are declared within that function those functions will have access to the variables of the outer functions. This is called a scope chain. It works in the following manner:
When a function look to resolve a variable value it first looks at its own scope. This is the function body, i.e. everything between curly brackets {} (except for variables inside other functions which are in this scope).
If it cannot find the variable inside the function body it will climb up to the chain and look at the variable scope in the function in where the function was defined. This is what is meant with lexical scope, we can see in the code where this function was defined and thus can determine the scope chain by merely looking at the code.
Example:
// global scope
var foo = 'global';
var bar = 'global';
var foobar = 'global';

function outerFunc () {
 // outerFunc scope
 var foo = 'outerFunc';
 var foobar = 'outerFunc';
 innerFunc();
 
 function innerFunc(){
 // innerFunc scope
  var foo = 'innerFunc';
  console.log(foo);
  console.log(bar);
  console.log(foobar);
  }
}

outerFunc();
Run code snippetExpand snippet
What happens when we are trying to log the variables foo, bar, and foobar to the console is the following:
We try to log foo to the console, foo can be found inside the function innerFunc itself. Therefore, the value of foo is resolved to the string innerFunc.
We try to log bar to the console, bar cannot be found inside the function innerFunc itself. Therefore, we need to climb the scope chain. We first look in the outer function in which the function innerFunc was defined. This is the function outerFunc. In the scope of outerFunc we can find the variable bar, which holds the string 'outerFunc'.
foobar cannot be found in innerFunc. . Therefore, we need to climb the scope chain to the innerFunc scope. It also cannot be found here, we climb another level to the global scope (i.e. the outermost scope). We find the variable foobar here which holds the string 'global'. If it wouldnot have found the variable after climbing the scope chain the JS engine would throw a referenceError.
ES6 (ES 2015) and older:
The same concepts of lexically scope and scopechain still apply in ES6. However a new ways to declare variables were introduced. There are the following:
let: creates a block scoped variable
const: creates a block scoped variable which has to be initialized and cannot be reassigned
The biggest difference between var and let/const is that var is function scoped whereas let/const are block scoped. Here is an example to illustrate this:
let letVar = 'global';
var varVar = 'global';

function foo () {
  
  if (true) {
    // this variable declared with let is scoped to the if block, block scoped
    let letVar = 5;
    // this variable declared with let is scoped to the function block, function scoped
    var varVar = 10;
  }
  
  console.log(letVar);
  console.log(varVar);
}

3895,500431,Ahmed Khashaba,2848816,"I really like the accepted answer but I want to add this:
Scope collects and maintains a look-up list of all the declared identifiers (variables), and enforces a strict set of rules as to how these are accessible to currently executing code.
Scope is a set of rules for looking up variables by their identifier name.
If a variable cannot be found in the immediate scope, Engine consults the next outer containing scope, continuing until is found or until the outermost (a.k.a., global) scope has been reached.
Is the set of rules that determines where and how a variable (identifier) can be looked up. This look-up may be for the purposes of assigning to the variable, which is an LHS (left-hand-side) reference, or it may be for the purposes of retrieving its value, which is an RHS (righthand-side) reference.
LHS references result from assignment operations. Scope-related assignments can occur either with the = operator or by passing arguments to (assign to) function parameters.
The JavaScript engine first compiles code before it executes, and in so doing, it splits up statements like var a = 2; into two separate steps: 1st. First, var a to declare it in that scope. This is performed at the beginning, before code execution. 2nd. Later, a = 2 to look up the variable (LHS reference) and assign to it if found.
Both LHS and RHS reference look-ups start at the currently executing scope, and if need be (that is, they don’t find what they’re looking for there), they work their way up the nested scope, one scope (floor) at a time, looking for the identifier, until they get to the global (top floor) and stop, and either find it, or don’t. Unfulfilled RHS references result in ReferenceError being thrown. Unfulfilled LHS references result in an automatic, implicitly created global of that name (if not in Strict Mode), or a ReferenceError (if in Strict Mode).
scope consists of a series of “bubbles” that each act as a container or bucket, in which identifiers (variables, functions) are declared. These bubbles nest neatly inside each other, and this nesting is defined at author time.",2020-05-25 16:11:42Z,1

3922,74579373,Stephen C,139985,"The code you are looking is fetching a Node from the map, creating and adding a new Node if one is not present.
Clearly, this operation needs to be thread-safe. The simple ways to implement this would be:
Lock the map and perform get and put operations while holding the lock.
Use a ConcurrentHashMap which has operations for doing this kind of thing atomically; e.g. computeIfAbsent.
The authors of this code have chosen a different approach. They are using so-called Double Checked Locking (DCL) to avoid doing the initial get while holding a lock. That is what this code does:
    DefaultNode node = map.get(context.getName());
    if (node == null) {
        synchronized (this) {
            node = map.get(context.getName());
            ...
The authors have decided that when they then need to add a new entry to the map they need to do it by replacing the entire map with a new one. On the face of it, that seems unnecessary. The map updates are being performed while holding the lock and the volatile adds a happens before that seems to ensure that the initial map.get call sees any recent writes to the HashMap.
But that reasoning is INCORRECT. The problem is that there is a small time window between fetching the map reference and the get call completing. During that time window, a simultaneous put operation may be updating the HashMap data structures. This is harmful because those changes could cause the get to read stale data (because there is no happens before relationship from the put writes to the get reads). Even worse, the put could trigger reconstruction of a hash chain or even an expansion of the hash array. The resulting behavior is (at least) outside of the HashMap spec, since HashMap is not defined to be thread-safe.
The authors' solution is to create a new HashMap with the existing entries and the new one, then update map with a single assignment. I haven't done a formal analysis, but I think that this approach is thread-safe.
In short, the reason that the code creates a new HashMap is to make the DCL approach thread-safe.
And if you ignore the thread-safety aspect, this approach is functionality equivalent to a simple put.
Finally, we need to consider whether the authors' approach is going to give optimal performance. The answer will depend on whether the number of cache entries stabilizes, and whether it is relatively small. One observation is that the cost of adding N entries to the cache is O(N^2) !! (Assuming that entries are never removed, as appears to be the case.)",2022-11-26 09:10:47Z,0

Forewords
This topic has been iterated at least a couple of thousands of times, here, in Stack Overflow. Hence, first off I'd like to point out some extremely useful resources:
@Felix Kling's answer to ""How do I return the response from an asynchronous call?"". See his excellent answer explaining synchronous and asynchronous flows, as well as the ""Restructure code"" section.
@Benjamin Gruenbaum has also put a lot of effort explaining asynchronicity in the same thread.
@Matt Esch's answer to ""Get data from fs.readFile"" also explains asynchronicity extremely well in a simple manner.
The answer to the question at hand
Let's trace the common behavior first. In all examples, the outerScopeVar is modified inside of a function. That function is clearly not executed immediately, it is being assigned or passed as an argument. That is what we call a callback.
Now the question is, when is that callback called?
It depends on the case. Let's try to trace some common behavior again:
img.onload may be called sometime in the future, when (and if) the image has successfully loaded.
setTimeout may be called sometime in the future, after the delay has expired and the timeout hasn't been canceled by clearTimeout. Note: even when using 0 as delay, all browsers have a minimum timeout delay cap (specified to be 4ms in the HTML5 spec).
jQuery $.post's callback may be called sometime in the future, when (and if) the Ajax request has been completed successfully.
Node.js's fs.readFile may be called sometime in the future, when the file has been read successfully or thrown an error.
In all cases, we have a callback which may run sometime in the future. This ""sometime in the future"" is what we refer to as asynchronous flow.
Asynchronous execution is pushed out of the synchronous flow. That is, the asynchronous code will never execute while the synchronous code stack is executing. This is the meaning of JavaScript being single-threaded.
More specifically, when the JS engine is idle -- not executing a stack of (a)synchronous code -- it will poll for events that may have triggered asynchronous callbacks (e.g. expired timeout, received network response) and execute them one after another. This is regarded as Event Loop.
That is, the asynchronous code highlighted in the hand-drawn red shapes may execute only after all the remaining synchronous code in their respective code blocks have executed:
In short, the callback functions are created synchronously but executed asynchronously. You just can't rely on the execution of an asynchronous function until you know it has executed, and how to do that?
It is simple, really. The logic that depends on the asynchronous function execution should be started/called from inside this asynchronous function. For example, moving the alerts and console.logs too inside the callback function would output the expected result, because the result is available at that point.
Implementing your own callback logic
Often you need to do more things with the result from an asynchronous function or do different things with the result depending on where the asynchronous function has been called. Let's tackle a bit more complex example:
var outerScopeVar;
helloCatAsync();
alert(outerScopeVar);

function helloCatAsync() {
    setTimeout(function() {
        outerScopeVar = 'Nya';
    }, Math.random() * 2000);
}
Note: I'm using setTimeout with a random delay as a generic asynchronous function, the same example applies to Ajax, readFile, onload and any other asynchronous flow.
This example clearly suffers from the same issue as the other examples, it is not waiting until the asynchronous function executes.
Let's tackle it implementing a callback system of our own. First off, we get rid of that ugly outerScopeVar which is completely useless in this case. Then we add a parameter which accepts a function argument, our callback. When the asynchronous operation finishes, we call this callback passing the result. The implementation (please read the comments in order):
// 1. Call helloCatAsync passing a callback function,
//    which will be called receiving the result from the async operation
helloCatAsync(function(result) {
    // 5. Received the result from the async function,
    //    now do whatever you want with it:
    alert(result);
});

// 2. The ""callback"" parameter is a reference to the function which
//    was passed as argument from the helloCatAsync call
function helloCatAsync(callback) {
    // 3. Start async operation:
    setTimeout(function() {
        // 4. Finished async operation,
        //    call the callback passing the result as argument
        callback('Nya');
    }, Math.random() * 2000);
}
Code snippet of the above example:
// 1. Call helloCatAsync passing a callback function,
//    which will be called receiving the result from the async operation
console.log(""1. function called..."")
helloCatAsync(function(result) {
    // 5. Received the result from the async function,
    //    now do whatever you want with it:
    console.log(""5. result is: "", result);
});

// 2. The ""callback"" parameter is a reference to the function which
//    was passed as argument from the helloCatAsync call
function helloCatAsync(callback) {
    console.log(""2. callback here is the function passed as argument above..."")
    // 3. Start async operation:
    setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(""3. start async operation..."")
    console.log(""4. finished async operation, calling the callback, passing the result..."")
        // 4. Finished async operation,
        //    call the callback passing the result as argument
        callback('Nya');
    }, Math.random() * 2000);
}
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Most often in real use cases, the DOM API and most libraries already provide the callback functionality (the helloCatAsync implementation in this demonstrative example). You only need to pass the callback function and understand that it will execute out of the synchronous flow, and restructure your code to accommodate for that.
You will also notice that due to the asynchronous nature, it is impossible to return a value from an asynchronous flow back to the synchronous flow where the callback was defined, as the asynchronous callbacks are executed long after the synchronous code has already finished executing.
Instead of returning a value from an asynchronous callback, you will have to make use of the callback pattern, or... Promises.
Promises
Although there are ways to keep the callback hell at bay with vanilla JS, promises are growing in popularity and are currently being standardized in ES6 (see Promise - MDN).
Promises (a.k.a. Futures) provide a more linear, and thus pleasant, reading of the asynchronous code, but explaining their entire functionality is out of the scope of this question. Instead, I'll leave these excellent resources for the interested:

An Analogy...
Yesterday, the work I was doing required some information from a colleague. I rang him up; here's how the conversation went:
Me: Hi Bob, I need to know how we foo'd the bar'd last week. Jim wants a report on it, and you're the only one who knows the details about it.
Bob: Sure thing, but it'll take me around 30 minutes?
Me: That's great Bob. Give me a ring back when you've got the information!
At this point, I hung up the phone. Since I needed information from Bob to complete my report, I left the report and went for a coffee instead, then I caught up on some email. 40 minutes later (Bob is slow), Bob called back and gave me the information I needed. At this point, I resumed my work with my report, as I had all the information I needed.
Imagine if the conversation had gone like this instead;
Me: Hi Bob, I need to know how we foo'd the bar'd last week. Jim want's a report on it, and you're the only one who knows the details about it.
Bob: Sure thing, but it'll take me around 30 minutes?
Me: That's great Bob. I'll wait.
And I sat there and waited. And waited. And waited. For 40 minutes. Doing nothing but waiting. Eventually, Bob gave me the information, we hung up, and I completed my report. But I'd lost 40 minutes of productivity.
This is asynchronous vs. synchronous behavior
This is exactly what is happening in all the examples in our question. Loading an image, loading a file off disk, and requesting a page via AJAX are all slow operations (in the context of modern computing).
Rather than waiting for these slow operations to complete, JavaScript lets you register a callback function which will be executed when the slow operation has completed. In the meantime, however, JavaScript will continue to execute other code. The fact that JavaScript executes other code whilst waiting for the slow operation to complete makes the behaviorasynchronous. Had JavaScript waited around for the operation to complete before executing any other code, this would have been synchronous behavior.
var outerScopeVar;    
var img = document.createElement('img');

// Here we register the callback function.
img.onload = function() {
    // Code within this function will be executed once the image has loaded.
    outerScopeVar = this.width;
};

// But, while the image is loading, JavaScript continues executing, and
// processes the following lines of JavaScript.
img.src = 'lolcat.png';
alert(outerScopeVar);
In the code above, we're asking JavaScript to load lolcat.png, which is a sloooow operation. The callback function will be executed once this slow operation has done, but in the meantime, JavaScript will keep processing the next lines of code; i.e. alert(outerScopeVar).
This is why we see the alert showing undefined; since the alert() is processed immediately, rather than after the image has been loaded.
In order to fix our code, all we have to do is move the alert(outerScopeVar) code into the callback function. As a consequence of this, we no longer need the outerScopeVar variable declared as a global variable.
var img = document.createElement('img');

img.onload = function() {
    var localScopeVar = this.width;
    alert(localScopeVar);
};

img.src = 'lolcat.png';
You'll always see a callback is specified as a function, because that's the only* way in JavaScript to define some code, but not execute it until later.
Therefore, in all of our examples, the function() { /* Do something */ } is the callback; to fix all the examples, all we have to do is move the code which needs the response of the operation into there!
* Technically you can use eval() as well, but eval() is evil for this purpose
How do I keep my caller waiting?
You might currently have some code similar to this;
function getWidthOfImage(src) {
    var outerScopeVar;

    var img = document.createElement('img');
    img.onload = function() {
        outerScopeVar = this.width;
    };
    img.src = src;
    return outerScopeVar;
}

var width = getWidthOfImage('lolcat.png');
alert(width);
However, we now know that the return outerScopeVar happens immediately; before the onload callback function has updated the variable. This leads to getWidthOfImage() returning undefined, and undefined being alerted.
To fix this, we need to allow the function calling getWidthOfImage() to register a callback, then move the alert'ing of the width to be within that callback;
function getWidthOfImage(src, cb) {     
    var img = document.createElement('img');
    img.onload = function() {
        cb(this.width);
    };
    img.src = src;
}

getWidthOfImage('lolcat.png', function (width) {
    alert(width);
});
... as before, note that we've been able to remove the global variables (in this case width).",2019-06-10 19:48:26Z,184
3947,23667086,JohnnyHK,1259510,"Here's a more concise answer for people that are looking for a quick reference as well as some examples using promises and async/await.
Start with the naive approach (that doesn't work) for a function that calls an asynchronous method (in this case setTimeout) and returns a message:
function getMessage() {
  var outerScopeVar;
  setTimeout(function() {
    outerScopeVar = 'Hello asynchronous world!';
  }, 0);
  return outerScopeVar;
}
console.log(getMessage());
undefined gets logged in this case because getMessage returns before the setTimeout callback is called and updates outerScopeVar.
The two main ways to solve it are using callbacks and promises:
Callbacks
The change here is that getMessage accepts a callback parameter that will be called to deliver the results back to the calling code once available.
function getMessage(callback) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    callback('Hello asynchronous world!');
  }, 0);
}
getMessage(function(message) {
  console.log(message);
});
Promises
Promises provide an alternative which is more flexible than callbacks because they can be naturally combined to coordinate multiple async operations. A Promises/A+ standard implementation is natively provided in node.js (0.12+) and many current browsers, but is also implemented in libraries like Bluebird and Q.
function getMessage() {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      resolve('Hello asynchronous world!');
    }, 0);
  });
}

getMessage().then(function(message) {
  console.log(message);  
});
jQuery Deferreds
jQuery provides functionality that's similar to promises with its Deferreds.
function getMessage() {
  var deferred = $.Deferred();
  setTimeout(function() {
    deferred.resolve('Hello asynchronous world!');
  }, 0);
  return deferred.promise();
}

getMessage().done(function(message) {
  console.log(message);  
});
async/await
If your JavaScript environment includes support for async and await (like Node.js 7.6+), then you can use promises synchronously within async functions:
function getMessage () {
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        setTimeout(function() {
            resolve('Hello asynchronous world!');
        }, 0);
    });
}

async function main() {
    let message = await getMessage();
    console.log(message);
}

3949,23667086,Teja,2446387,"The other answers are excellent and I just want to provide a straight forward answer to this. Just limiting to jQuery asynchronous calls
All ajax calls (including the $.get or $.post or $.ajax) are asynchronous.
Considering your example
var outerScopeVar;  //line 1
$.post('loldog', function(response) {  //line 2
    outerScopeVar = response;
});
alert(outerScopeVar);  //line 3
The code execution starts from line 1, declares the variable and triggers and asynchronous call on line 2, (i.e., the post request) and it continues its execution from line 3, without waiting for the post request to complete its execution.
Lets say that the post request takes 10 seconds to complete, the value of outerScopeVar will only be set after those 10 seconds.
To try out,
var outerScopeVar; //line 1
$.post('loldog', function(response) {  //line 2, takes 10 seconds to complete
    outerScopeVar = response;
});
alert(""Lets wait for some time here! Waiting is fun"");  //line 3
alert(outerScopeVar);  //line 4
Now when you execute this, you would get an alert on line 3. Now wait for some time until you are sure the post request has returned some value. Then when you click OK, on the alert box, next alert would print the expected value, because you waited for it.
In real life scenario, the code becomes,
var outerScopeVar;
$.post('loldog', function(response) {
    outerScopeVar = response;
    alert(outerScopeVar);
});

Let's discuss each examples(I marked the portion which is called asynchronously or delayed for some events to occur):
1.
Here we register an eventlistner which will be executed upon that particular event.Here loading of image.Then the current execution continuous with next lines img.src = 'lolcat.png'; and alert(outerScopeVar); meanwhile the event may not occur. i.e, funtion img.onload wait for the referred image to load, asynchrously. This will happen all the folowing example- the event may differ.
2.
Here the timeout event plays the role, which will invoke the handler after the specified time. Here it is 0, but still it registers an asynchronous event it will be added to the last position of the Event Queue for execution, which makes the guaranteed delay.
3.
This time ajax callback.
4.
Node can be consider as a king of asynchronous coding.Here the marked function is registered as a callback handler which will be executed after reading the specified file.
5.

3951,23667086,S M Samnoon Abrar,8188682,"The short answer is : asynchronicity.
Why asynchronous is needed?
JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning that two bits of the script cannot run at the same time; they have to run one after another. In browsers, JavaScript shares a thread with a load of other stuff that differs from browser to browser. But typically JavaScript is in the same queue as painting, updating styles, and handling user actions (such as highlighting text and interacting with form controls). Activity in one of these things delays the others.
You've probably used events and callbacks to get around this. Here are events:
var img1 = document.querySelector('.img-1');

img1.addEventListener('load', function() {
  // image loaded
  console.log(""Loaded"");
});

img1.addEventListener('error', function() {
  // error caught
  console.log(""Error printed"");
});
<img class=""img-1"" src=""#"" alt=""img"">
Run code snippetExpand snippet
This isn't sneezy at all. We get the image, add a couple of listeners, then JavaScript can stop executing until one of those listeners is called.
Unfortunately, in the example above, it's possible that the events happened before we started listening for them, so we need to work around that using the ""complete"" property of images:
var img1 = document.querySelector('.img-1');

function loaded() {
  // image loaded
  console.log(""Loaded"");
}

if (img1.complete) {
  loaded();
} else {
  img1.addEventListener('load', loaded);
}

img1.addEventListener('error', function() {
  // error caught
  console.log(""Error printed"");
});
<img class=""img-1"" src=""#"" alt=""img"">
Run code snippetExpand snippet
This doesn't catch images that errored before we got a chance to listen for them; unfortunately, the DOM doesn't give us a way to do that. Also, this is loading one image. Things get even more complex if we want to know when a set of images have loaded.
Events aren't always the best way
Events are great for things that can happen multiple times on the same object— keyup, touchstart etc. With those events, you don't really care about what happened before you attached the listener.
The two main ways to do it correctly: are callbacks and promises.
Callbacks
Callbacks are functions that are passed inside the arguments of other functions, this procedure is valid in JavaScript because functions are objects and objects can be passed as arguments to functions. The basic structure of the callback function looks something like this:
function getMessage(callback) {
  callback();
}

function showMessage() {
  console.log(""Hello world! I am a callback"");
}
getMessage(showMessage);
Run code snippetExpand snippet
Promise
Although there are ways to keep the callback hell at bay with vanilla JS, promises are growing in popularity and are currently being standardized in ES6 (see Promise).
A promise is a placeholder representing the eventual result (value) of an asynchronous operation
the promise placeholder will be replaced by the result value (if successful) or reason for failure (if unsuccessful)
If you don't need to know when something happened, but just whether it happened or not, then a promise is what you are looking for.
A promise is a bit like an event listener, except that:
a promise can only succeed or fail once
a promise can't switch from fail to success, or vice versa
once you have a result, the promise is immutable
if a promise has succeeded or failed, and you later add a success/failure callback, the correct callback will be called
it doesn't matter that the event occurred before you added the callback
Note: Always return a result from a function inside a Promise, otherwise there's nothing for the subsequent function to act on.
Promise Terminology
A promise can be:
fulfilled: The action relating to the promise succeeded
the asynchronous operation has completed
the promise has a value
the promise will not change again
rejected: The action relating to the promise failed
the asynchronous operation failed
the promise will never be fulfilled
the promise has a reason indicating why the operation failed
the promise will not change again
pending: Hasn't fulfilled or rejected yet
the asynchronous operation hasn't been completed yet
can transition to fulfilled or rejected
settled: Has been fulfilled or rejected and is thus immutable
How to Create a Promise

  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(function() {

3980,46544780,eyllanesc,6622587,"To avoid having these problems it is advisable not to modify this file but to create a new file where we implement a class that uses that design.
For example, suppose you have used the MainWindow template in the design.ui file, then convert it to Ui_Design.py like to the following structure:
from PyQt5 import QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets

class Ui_MainWindow(object):
    def setupUi(self, MainWindow):
        [...]

    def retranslateUi(self, MainWindow):
        [...]
Then we will create a new file that we will call logic.py where we will create the file that handles the logic and that uses the previous design:
class Logic(QMainWindow, Ui_MainWindow):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        QMainWindow.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)
        self.setupUi(self)
So even if you modify the design and generate the file again .py you will not have to modify the file of the logic.
To generalize the idea we must have the following rules but for this the logic class must have the following structure:
class Logic(PyQtClass, DesignClass):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        PyQtClass.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)
        self.setupUi(self)

3985,74579269,Magoo,2128947,"Addressing the core of the problem:
start EXAMPLE.exe %CommandVar1% & start EXAMPLE.exe %CommandVar2%
Will start two instances of example.exe passing the contents of commandvar? which may be response to ""Insert ID:"" or (rarely) nothing
Immediately thereafter, you are executing tasklist and looking for :.
If either the tasks have actually been established and is running, the tasklist output will NOT contain : so find will NOT find : and hence set errorlevel to 1
If the tasks have not been started or have both terminated, then the output of tasklist would be INFO: No tasks are running which match the specified criteria. which contains : and hence errorlevel will be set to 0.
Your next line says if **either** task is running (errorlevel 1), say ""not found"" and go to Begin otherwise (ie. neither task is running) then delay, taskkill the non-existent tasks, delay again and go back to Begin.
Another hidden problem is that when the routine returns to begin, if CommandVar2 has been set, then it will not be cleared, so it will remain set for the next input-cycle, regardless of the data input.
So we need to tackle the logic problems as well as the batch-syntax-specific problems.
Tip: Use set ""var=value"" for setting string values - this avoids problems caused by trailing spaces. Don't assign "" or a terminal backslash or Space. Build pathnames from the elements - counterintuitively, it is likely to make the process easier. If the syntax set var=""value"" is used, then the quotes become part of the value assigned.
First thing to tackle is the choose-and-check part. The value assigned to a variable by a set /p can be any string. That string may be the expected string or an unexpected string (obviously). An unexpected string may take many forms - it might contain spaces for instance, or unbalanced quotes, or % or parentheses or other strings or characters that have significance in the batch language. Also, responding with Enter to a set /p will leave the variable unchanged, not set it to nothing.
When the obvious parameter-check is executed via if %var1% == %var2% ..., then the values of the variables are substituted, and the comparison executed, so had the user input break me for instance, then batch would attempt to execute if break me == 2 ... and batch would see me where it expects to see a comparison-operator like ==.
The usual way to by-pass this problem is by ""quoting both sides"", ie. if ""%var1%"" == ""%var2%"" ... This is useful in the case that you may be processing some string containing spaces that is being returned from a command, but what happens if the user enters break "" me ?
Consequently, the recommendation is to use the choice command to make 1-character choices (see choice /? from the prompt for documentation, or thousands of items on SO for examples)
Hence, your code should be
choice /c 12 /M ""Insert a number (min. 1 - max. 2): ""
set ""CommandVar0=%errorlevel%""
choice /c 12 /M ""Please confirm the number you entered: ""
set ""CommandVarC=%errorlevel%""
At this point, we are sure that commandvar? contains 1 or 2, so we can indeed use
if %CommandVarC% NEQ %CommandVar0% (
 echo Insert a matching number between 1~2 for confirmation
 goto Begin
) 
Note: I've used the string-assignment syntax, even though the value assigned from %errorlevel% must be a pure-numeric string. It's also possible to use set /a var=%errorlevel% here. set /a assigns a value that we know is numeric (and can also do calculations) and needs no quotes.
There's no point in else... here -it serves to complicate matters. The code will simply continue to the next line if the goto is not executed.
 if %CommandVarC% GTR 2 (echo Maximum number is 2.
    goto Begin
    ) else (
is not required. We know that CommandVarC can only be 1 or 2.
if %CommandVar0% == 1 set /P CommandVar1=Insert ID: 
if %CommandVar0% == 2 set /P CommandVar1=Insert ID: & set /P CommandVar2=Insert ID: 
Well, this is overcomplicated, and doesn't quite do what is required. CommandVar1 is always required, and CommandVar2 will remain set if it has been set in the past.
Try:
set ""commandvar1=""
set ""commandvar2=""
set /P CommandVar1=Insert ID: 
if not defined commandvar1 goto begin
if %CommandVar0% == 2 set /P CommandVar2=Insert ID: 
Well, primitively. We know commandvar0 is a single digit, so we can use a simple ==. We also may or may not have received a response for commandvar2.
So
if ""%CommandVar0%""==""2"" (
 set /P CommandVar2=Insert ID: 
 if not defined commandvar2 goto begin
)
may be more ""according to Hoyle""
Summing up (before we tackle the next part), try using
choice /c 12 /M ""Insert a number (min. 1 - max. 2): ""
set ""CommandVar0=%errorlevel%""
choice /c 12 /M ""Please confirm the number you entered: ""
set ""CommandVarC=%errorlevel%""

if %CommandVarC% NEQ %CommandVar0% (
 echo Insert a matching number between 1~2 for confirmation
 goto Begin
) 

set ""commandvar1=""
set ""commandvar2=""
set /P CommandVar1=Insert ID: 
if not defined commandvar1 goto begin
if ""%CommandVar0%""==""2"" (
 set /P CommandVar2=Insert ID: 
 if not defined commandvar2 goto begin
)
If we get past this point, I gather we should launch the executable, possibly twice, then wait for it to run, with a run-time limit of 10 seconds.
So,
start EXAMPLE.exe %CommandVar1%
rem only start a second instance if commandvar2 has been specified
if defined commandvar2 start EXAMPLE.exe %CommandVar2%
rem wait a sec...or 10
for /L %%y in (1,1,10) do (
 timeout /t 1 >nul
 tasklist /fi ""imagename eq EXAMPLE.exe"" |find "":"" > nul
 if NOT errorlevel 1 goto begin
)
rem kill tasks still running
taskkill /f /im EXAMPLE.exe
timeout /t 5 
goto begin
for /L is explained at for /? from the prompt. Here, it counts %%y from 1 to 10 in steps of 1.
Each step delays 1 second (the >nul suppresses the countdown) then tests whether an executable is running. If NONE is running, then the tasklist will report a line containing : and errorlevel will be set to 0.
IF ERRORLEVEL n is TRUE if the runtime (ie. current) errorlevel is n or greater than n. IF ERRORLEVEL 0 is therefore always true. IF NOT ERRORLEVEL 1 is a test for errorlevel=0.
So, if there is no executable running, goto begin.
Once this test has been done 10 times, if an executable is running, then we exit the for /L loop and taskkill the remaining task(s) and back to the future...
--- To add Commandvars ---
The method is limited to 9 items without complications.
Change the 12 in the choice commands to 123456789 (or whatever your limit is).
add
for /L %%e in (1,1,9) do set ""commandvar%%e=""
in place of set ""commandvar1=""  set ""commandvar2=""  
This will set all variablenames commandvar1..9 to nothing.
Then
for /L %%e in (1,1,9) do (
 set /P CommandVar%%e=""Insert ID for instance %%e: ""
 if not defined commandvar%%e (
  if %%e==1 goto begin
  goto startprocs
 )
)
:startprocs
for /L %%e in (1,1,9) do if defined commandvar%%e call start ""Instance %%e"" u:\dummy.bat %%commandvar%%e%%
Note that the set/p has a quoted prompt-string. This allows the string to have a terminal space. It's possible to have that string ""nude"" but if your editor gets over-enthusiastic and removes terminal spaces, then you'd lose that one. It also serves to make the space obvious (stray spaces can cause havoc in batch)
Then input your data. If the first entry is empty, back to the start. You could change that goto to an exit, which would terminate the cmd instance. or exit /b which would terminate this batch, but keep your cmd session open.
If any other entry is empty, it's the signal to start processing as we've finished our list.
The for /L for starting the processes has been changed a little. First, the start is immediately followed by a quoted string. This is the title which would appear in the process's window. It could be empty if you wish, but it should not be omitted in the general case. Start regards the first quoted string in the command as the window title to be used, so if it is omitted, a quoted string in the command may be eaten by start, used as a title and not passed to the process being started.
Then there's the call. This invokes a parser trick. Suppose %%e is 2. The command would be executed as call start ""Instance 2"" u:\dummy.bat %%commandvar%%e%% where %%commandvar%%e%% would be interpreted left-to-right as %commandvar2% as % is the ""escape character"" for %. Escaping a character is where we want to use a character without its special meaning. %%e is replaced by 2 first because it's an active metavariable (loop-control character or parameter-number). CALLin the resultant command start ""Instance 2"" u:\dummy.bat %commandvar2% then substitutes the current value of commandvar2 for the process.
=== Summary thought ===
With this new approach to have multiple commandvaar entries, there appears to be no reason for the nomination of a number of entries and then checking that number, so that entire section could be regarded as redundant.
If you remove that section, then there's no reason for the restriction to 9 items. You could set the limit to any number you like by replacing the 9 with 22, 35, 957 - whatever takes your fancy. The process will now start whenever you reply Enter to a prompt Insert ID for instance ??: ",2022-11-26 16:22:19Z,3

The precedence among the syntax rules of translation is specified by the following phases [see footnote].
Physical source file characters are mapped, in an implementation-defined manner, to the basic source character set (introducing new-line characters for end-of-line indicators) if necessary. [SNIP]
Each instance of a backslash character (\) immediately followed by a new-line character is deleted, splicing physical source lines to form logical source lines. [SNIP]
The source file is decomposed into preprocessing tokens (2.5) and sequences of white-space characters (including comments). [SNIP]
Preprocessing directives are executed, macro invocations are expanded, and _Pragma unary operator expressions are executed. [SNIP]
Each source character set member in a character literal or a string literal, as well as each escape sequence and universal-character-name in a character literal or a non-raw string literal, is converted to the corresponding member of the execution character set; [SNIP]
Adjacent string literal tokens are concatenated.
White-space characters separating tokens are no longer significant. Each preprocessing token is converted into a token. (2.7). The resulting tokens are syntactically and semantically analyzed and translated as a translation unit. [SNIP]
Translated translation units and instantiation units are combined as follows: [SNIP]
All external entity references are resolved. Library components are linked to satisfy external references to entities not defined in the current translation. All such translator output is collected into a program image which contains information needed for execution in its execution environment. (emphasis mine)
[footnote] Implementations must behave as if these separate phases occur, although in practice different phases might be folded together.
The specified errors occur during this last stage of compilation, most commonly referred to as linking. It basically means that you compiled a bunch of implementation files into object files or libraries and now you want to get them to work together.
Say you defined symbol a in a.cpp. Now, b.cpp declared that symbol and used it. Before linking, it simply assumes that that symbol was defined somewhere, but it doesn't yet care where. The linking phase is responsible for finding the symbol and correctly linking it to b.cpp (well, actually to the object or library that uses it).
If you're using Microsoft Visual Studio, you'll see that projects generate .lib files. These contain a table of exported symbols, and a table of imported symbols. The imported symbols are resolved against the libraries you link against, and the exported symbols are provided for the libraries that use that .lib (if any).
Similar mechanisms exist for other compilers/ platforms.

4012,12573816,Praetorian,241631,"Class members:
A pure virtual destructor needs an implementation.
Declaring a destructor pure still requires you to define it (unlike a regular function):
struct X
{
    virtual ~X() = 0;
};
struct Y : X
{
    ~Y() {}
};
int main()
{
    Y y;
}
//X::~X(){} //uncomment this line for successful definition
This happens because base class destructors are called when the object is destroyed implicitly, so a definition is required.
virtual methods must either be implemented or defined as pure.
This is similar to non-virtual methods with no definition, with the added reasoning that the pure declaration generates a dummy vtable and you might get the linker error without using the function:
struct X
{
    virtual void foo();
};
struct Y : X
{
   void foo() {}
};
int main()
{
   Y y; //linker error although there was no call to X::foo
}
For this to work, declare X::foo() as pure:
struct X
{
    virtual void foo() = 0;
};
Non-virtual class members
Some members need to be defined even if not used explicitly:
struct A
{ 
    ~A();
};
The following would yield the error:
A a;      //destructor undefined
The implementation can be inline, in the class definition itself:
struct A
{ 
    ~A() {}
};
or outside:
A::~A() {}
If the implementation is outside the class definition, but in a header, the methods have to be marked as inline to prevent a multiple definition.
All used member methods need to be defined if used.
A common mistake is forgetting to qualify the name:
struct A
{
   void foo();
};

void foo() {}

int main()
{
   A a;
   a.foo();
}
The definition should be
void A::foo() {}
static data members must be defined outside the class in a single translation unit:
struct X
{
    static int x;
};
int main()
{
    int x = X::x;
}
//int X::x; //uncomment this line to define X::x
An initializer can be provided for a static const data member of integral or enumeration type within the class definition; however, odr-use of this member will still require a namespace scope definition as described above. C++11 allows initialization inside the class for all static const data members.",2014-09-09 01:06:32Z,195
4013,12573816,HolyBlackCat,2752075,"Failure to link against appropriate libraries/object files or compile implementation files
Commonly, each translation unit will generate an object file that contains the definitions of the symbols defined in that translation unit. To use those symbols, you have to link against those object files.
Under gcc you would specify all object files that are to be linked together in the command line, or compile the implementation files together.
g++ -o test objectFile1.o objectFile2.o -lLibraryName
-l... must be to the right of any .o/.c/.cpp files.
The libraryName here is just the bare name of the library, without platform-specific additions. So e.g. on Linux library files are usually called libfoo.so but you'd only write -lfoo. On Windows that same file might be called foo.lib, but you'd use the same argument. You might have to add the directory where those files can be found using -L‹directory›. Make sure to not write a space after -l or -L.
For XCode: Add the User Header Search Paths -> add the Library Search Path -> drag and drop the actual library reference into the project folder.
Under MSVS, files added to a project automatically have their object files linked together and a lib file would be generated (in common usage). To use the symbols in a separate project, you'd need to include the lib files in the project settings. This is done in the Linker section of the project properties, in Input -> Additional Dependencies. (the path to the lib file should be added in Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories) When using a third-party library that is provided with a lib file, failure to do so usually results in the error.
It can also happen that you forget to add the file to the compilation, in which case the object file won't be generated. In gcc you'd add the files to the command line. In MSVS adding the file to the project will make it compile it automatically (albeit files can, manually, be individually excluded from the build).
In Windows programming, the tell-tale sign that you did not link a necessary library is that the name of the unresolved symbol begins with __imp_. Look up the name of the function in the documentation, and it should say which library you need to use. For example, MSDN puts the information in a box at the bottom of each function in a section called ""Library"".",2022-05-19 13:10:09Z,134
4014,12573816,Community,-1,"Declared but did not define a variable or function.
A typical variable declaration is
extern int x;
As this is only a declaration, a single definition is needed. A corresponding definition would be:
int x;
For example, the following would generate an error:
extern int x;
int main()
{
    x = 0;
}
//int x; // uncomment this line for successful definition
Similar remarks apply to functions. Declaring a function without defining it leads to the error:
void foo(); // declaration only
int main()
{
   foo();
}
//void foo() {} //uncomment this line for successful definition
Be careful that the function you implement exactly matches the one you declared. For example, you may have mismatched cv-qualifiers:
void foo(int& x);
int main()
{
   int x;
   foo(x);
}
void foo(const int& x) {} //different function, doesn't provide a definition
                          //for void foo(int& x)
                          
Other examples of mismatches include
Function/variable declared in one namespace, defined in another.
Function/variable declared as class member, defined as global (or vice versa).
Function return type, parameter number and types, and calling convention do not all exactly agree.
The error message from the compiler will often give you the full declaration of the variable or function that was declared but never defined. Compare it closely to the definition you provided. Make sure every detail matches.",2020-06-20 09:12:55Z,114
4015,12573816,Community,-1,"The order in which interdependent linked libraries are specified is wrong.

I'll try to explain what is an ""undefined reference/unresolved external symbol"".
note: i use g++ and Linux and all examples is for it
For example we have some code
// src1.cpp
void print();

static int local_var_name; // 'static' makes variable not visible for other modules
int global_var_name = 123;

int main()
{
    print();
    return 0;

and
// src2.cpp
extern ""C"" int printf (const char*, ...);

extern int global_var_name;
//extern int local_var_name;

void print ()
{
    // printf(""%d%d\n"", global_var_name, local_var_name);
    printf(""%d\n"", global_var_name);
}
Make object files
$ g++ -c src1.cpp -o src1.o
$ g++ -c src2.cpp -o src2.o
After the assembler phase we have an object file, which contains any symbols to export. Look at the symbols
$ readelf --symbols src1.o
  Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
     5: 0000000000000000     4 OBJECT  LOCAL  DEFAULT    4 _ZL14local_var_name # [1]
     9: 0000000000000000     4 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT    3 global_var_name     # [2]
I've rejected some lines from output, because they do not matter
So, we see follow symbols to export.
[1] - this is our static (local) variable (important - Bind has a type ""LOCAL"")
[2] - this is our global variable
src2.cpp exports nothing and we have seen no its symbols
Link our object files
$ g++ src1.o src2.o -o prog
and run it
$ ./prog
123
Linker sees exported symbols and links it. Now we try to uncomment lines in src2.cpp like here
// src2.cpp
extern ""C"" int printf (const char*, ...);

extern int global_var_name;
extern int local_var_name;

void print ()
{
    printf(""%d%d\n"", global_var_name, local_var_name);
}
and rebuild an object file
$ g++ -c src2.cpp -o src2.o
OK (no errors), because we only build object file, linking is not done yet. Try to link
$ g++ src1.o src2.o -o prog
src2.o: In function `print()':
src2.cpp:(.text+0x6): undefined reference to `local_var_name'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
It has happened because our local_var_name is static, i.e. it is not visible for other modules. Now more deeply. Get the translation phase output
$ g++ -S src1.cpp -o src1.s

// src1.s
look src1.s

    .file   ""src1.cpp""
    .local  _ZL14local_var_name
    .comm   _ZL14local_var_name,4,4
    .globl  global_var_name

So, we've seen there is no label for local_var_name, that's why linker hasn't found it. But we are hackers :) and we can fix it. Open src1.s in your text editor and change
.local  _ZL14local_var_name
.comm   _ZL14local_var_name,4,4
to
    .globl  local_var_name

    .type   local_var_name, @object
    .size   local_var_name, 4
local_var_name:
    .long   456789
i.e. you should have like below
    .file   ""src1.cpp""
    .globl  local_var_name
    .data
    .align 4
    .type   local_var_name, @object

global_var_name:
    .long   123
    .text
    .globl  main
    .type   main, @function
main:

we have changed the visibility of local_var_name and set its value to 456789. Try to build an object file from it
$ g++ -c src1.s -o src2.o
ok, see readelf output (symbols)
$ readelf --symbols src1.o

I was recently able to get rid of an unresolved external error in Visual Studio 2012 just by recompiling the offending file. When I re-built, the error went away.
This usually happens when two (or more) libraries have a cyclic dependency. Library A attempts to use symbols in B.lib and library B attempts to use symbols from A.lib. Neither exist to start off with. When you attempt to compile A, the link step will fail because it can't find B.lib. A.lib will be generated, but no dll. You then compile B, which will succeed and generate B.lib. Re-compiling A will now work because B.lib is now found.",2013-12-03 20:56:14Z,74
4019,12573816,Community,-1,"Template implementations not visible.
Unspecialized templates must have their definitions visible to all translation units that use them. That means you can't separate the definition of a template to an implementation file. If you must separate the implementation, the usual workaround is to have an impl file which you include at the end of the header that declares the template. A common situation is:
template<class T>
struct X
{
    void foo();
};

int main()
{
    X<int> x;
    x.foo();
}

//differentImplementationFile.cpp
template<class T>
void X<T>::foo()
{
}
To fix this, you must move the definition of X::foo to the header file or some place visible to the translation unit that uses it.
Specialized templates can be implemented in an implementation file and the implementation doesn't have to be visible, but the specialization must be previously declared.

4020,12573816,Teivaz,3344612,"This is one of most confusing error messages that every VC++ programmers have seen time and time again. Let’s make things clarity first.
A. What is symbol? In short, a symbol is a name. It can be a variable name, a function name, a class name, a typedef name, or anything except those names and signs that belong to C++ language. It is user defined or introduced by a dependency library (another user-defined).
B. What is external? In VC++, every source file (.cpp,.c,etc.) is considered as a translation unit, the compiler compiles one unit at a time, and generate one object file(.obj) for the current translation unit. (Note that every header file that this source file included will be preprocessed and will be considered as part of this translation unit)Everything within a translation unit is considered as internal, everything else is considered as external. In C++, you may reference an external symbol by using keywords like extern, __declspec (dllimport) and so on.
C. What is “resolve”? Resolve is a linking-time term. In linking-time, linker attempts to find the external definition for every symbol in object files that cannot find its definition internally. The scope of this searching process including:
All object files that generated in compiling time
All libraries (.lib) that are either explicitly or implicitly specified as additional dependencies of this building application.
This searching process is called resolve.
D. Finally, why Unresolved External Symbol? If the linker cannot find the external definition for a symbol that has no definition internally, it reports an Unresolved External Symbol error.
E. Possible causes of LNK2019: Unresolved External Symbol error. We already know that this error is due to the linker failed to find the definition of external symbols, the possible causes can be sorted as:
Definition exists
For example, if we have a function called foo defined in a.cpp:
int foo()
{
    return 0;
}
In b.cpp we want to call function foo, so we add
void foo();
to declare function foo(), and call it in another function body, say bar():
void bar()
{
    foo();
}
Now when you build this code you will get a LNK2019 error complaining that foo is an unresolved symbol. In this case, we know that foo() has its definition in a.cpp, but different from the one we are calling(different return value). This is the case that definition exists.
Definition does not exist
If we want to call some functions in a library, but the import library is not added into the additional dependency list (set from: Project | Properties | Configuration Properties | Linker | Input | Additional Dependency) of your project setting. Now the linker will report a LNK2019 since the definition does not exist in current searching scope.",2017-11-08 09:05:14Z,65
4021,12573816,Community,-1,"Incorrectly importing/exporting methods/classes across modules/dll (compiler specific).
MSVS requires you to specify which symbols to export and import using __declspec(dllexport) and __declspec(dllimport).
This dual functionality is usually obtained through the use of a macro:
#ifdef THIS_MODULE
#define DLLIMPEXP __declspec(dllexport)
#else
#define DLLIMPEXP __declspec(dllimport)
#endif
The macro THIS_MODULE would only be defined in the module that exports the function. That way, the declaration:
DLLIMPEXP void foo();
expands to
__declspec(dllexport) void foo();
and tells the compiler to export the function, as the current module contains its definition. When including the declaration in a different module, it would expand to
__declspec(dllimport) void foo();

Let's says we are on Windows and we build our project in Visual Studio 20xx. When you press Ctrl + F7 Visual Studio to start compiling the whole solution ( suppose we have just one project in the solution )
What's the meaning of compilation ?
Visual Studio search into file .vcxproj and start compiling each file which has the extension .cpp. Order of compilation is undefined.So you must not assume that the file main.cpp is compiled first
If .cpp files depends on additional .h files in order to find symbols that may or may not be defined in the file .cpp
If exists one .cpp file in which the compiler could not find one symbol, a compiler time error raises the message Symbol x could not be found
For each file with extension .cpp is generated an object file .o and also Visual Studio writes the output in a file named ProjectName.Cpp.Clean.txt which contains all object files that must be processed by the linker.
The Second step of compilation is done by Linker.Linker should merge all the object file and build finally the output ( which may be an executable or a library)
Steps In Linking a project
Parse all the object files and find the definition which was only declared in headers ( eg: The code of one method of a class as is mentioned in previous answers, or event the initialization of a static variable which is member inside a class)
If one symbol could not be found in object files he also is searched in Additional Libraries.For adding a new library to a project Configuration properties -> VC++ Directories -> Library Directories and here you specified additional folder for searching libraries and Configuration properties -> Linker -> Input for specifying the name of the library. -If the Linker could not find the symbol which you write in one .cpp he raises a linker time error which may sound like error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol ""void __cdecl foo(void)"" (?foo@@YAXXZ)
Observation
Once the Linker find one symbol he doesn't search in other libraries for it
The order of linking libraries does matter.
If Linker finds an external symbol in one static library he includes the symbol in the output of the project.However, if the library is shared( dynamic ) he doesn't include the code ( symbols ) in output, but Run-Time crashes may occur
How To Solve this kind of error
Compiler Time Error :
Make sure you write your c++ project syntactical correct.
Linker Time Error
Define all your symbol which you declare in your header files
Use #pragma once for allowing compiler not to include one header if it was already included in the current .cpp which are compiled
Make sure that your external library doesn't contain symbols that may enter into conflict with other symbols you defined in your header files

One possible reason for linker errors with GCC 5.2.0 is that a new libstdc++ library ABI is now chosen by default.
If you get linker errors about undefined references to symbols that involve types in the std::__cxx11 namespace or the tag [abi:cxx11] then it probably indicates that you are trying to link together object files that were compiled with different values for the _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI macro. This commonly happens when linking to a third-party library that was compiled with an older version of GCC. If the third-party library cannot be rebuilt with the new ABI then you will need to recompile your code with the old ABI.
So if you suddenly get linker errors when switching to a GCC after 5.1.0 this would be a thing to check out.",2015-09-10 11:03:35Z,26

But all the undefined somethings are declared in the header files you have #included and are in fact defined in the libraries that you are linking.
Examples are in C. They could equally well be C++
A minimal example involving a static library you built yourself
my_lib.c
#include ""my_lib.h""
#include <stdio.h>

void hw(void)
{
    puts(""Hello World"");
}
my_lib.h
#ifndef MY_LIB_H
#define MT_LIB_H

extern void hw(void);

#endif
eg1.c
#include <my_lib.h>

int main()
{
    hw();
    return 0;
}
You build your static library:
$ gcc -c -o my_lib.o my_lib.c
$ ar rcs libmy_lib.a my_lib.o
You compile your program:
$ gcc -I. -c -o eg1.o eg1.c
You try to link it with libmy_lib.a and fail:
$ gcc -o eg1 -L. -lmy_lib eg1.o 
eg1.o: In function `main':
eg1.c:(.text+0x5): undefined reference to `hw'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
The same result if you compile and link in one step, like:
$ gcc -o eg1 -I. -L. -lmy_lib eg1.c
/tmp/ccQk1tvs.o: In function `main':
eg1.c:(.text+0x5): undefined reference to `hw'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
A minimal example involving a shared system library, the compression library libz
eg2.c
#include <zlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf(""%s\n"",zlibVersion());
    return 0;
}
Compile your program:
$ gcc -c -o eg2.o eg2.c
Try to link your program with libz and fail:
$ gcc -o eg2 -lz eg2.o 
eg2.o: In function `main':
eg2.c:(.text+0x5): undefined reference to `zlibVersion'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
Same if you compile and link in one go:
$ gcc -o eg2 -I. -lz eg2.c
/tmp/ccxCiGn7.o: In function `main':
eg2.c:(.text+0x5): undefined reference to `zlibVersion'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
And a variation on example 2 involving pkg-config:
$ gcc -o eg2 $(pkg-config --libs zlib) eg2.o 
eg2.o: In function `main':
eg2.c:(.text+0x5): undefined reference to `zlibVersion'
What are you doing wrong?
In the sequence of object files and libraries you want to link to make your program, you are placing the libraries before the object files that refer to them. You need to place the libraries after the object files that refer to them.
Link example 1 correctly:
$ gcc -o eg1 eg1.o -L. -lmy_lib
Success:
$ ./eg1 
Hello World
Link example 2 correctly:
$ gcc -o eg2 eg2.o -lz
Success:
$ ./eg2 
1.2.8
Link the example 2 pkg-config variation correctly:
$ gcc -o eg2 eg2.o $(pkg-config --libs zlib) 
$ ./eg2
1.2.8
The explanation
Reading is optional from here on.
By default, a linkage command generated by GCC, on your distro, consumes the files in the linkage from left to right in commandline sequence. When it finds that a file refers to something and does not contain a definition for it, to will search for a definition in files further to the right. If it eventually finds a definition, the reference is resolved. If any references remain unresolved at the end, the linkage fails: the linker does not search backwards.
First, example 1, with static library my_lib.a
A static library is an indexed archive of object files. When the linker finds -lmy_lib in the linkage sequence and figures out that this refers to the static library ./libmy_lib.a, it wants to know whether your program needs any of the object files in libmy_lib.a.
There is only object file in libmy_lib.a, namely my_lib.o, and there's only one thing defined in my_lib.o, namely the function hw.
The linker will decide that your program needs my_lib.o if and only if it already knows that your program refers to hw, in one or more of the object files it has already added to the program, and that none of the object files it has already added contains a definition for hw.
If that is true, then the linker will extract a copy of my_lib.o from the library and add it to your program. Then, your program contains a definition for hw, so its references to hw are resolved.
When you try to link the program like:
$ gcc -o eg1 -L. -lmy_lib eg1.o
the linker has not added eg1.o to the program when it sees -lmy_lib. Because at that point, it has not seen eg1.o. Your program does not yet make any references to hw: it does not yet make any references at all, because all the references it makes are in eg1.o.
So the linker does not add my_lib.o to the program and has no further use for libmy_lib.a.
Next, it finds eg1.o, and adds it to be program. An object file in the linkage sequence is always added to the program. Now, the program makes a reference to hw, and does not contain a definition of hw; but there is nothing left in the linkage sequence that could provide the missing definition. The reference to hw ends up unresolved, and the linkage fails.
Second, example 2, with shared library libz
A shared library isn't an archive of object files or anything like it. It's much more like a program that doesn't have a main function and instead exposes multiple other symbols that it defines, so that other programs can use them at runtime.
Many Linux distros today configure their GCC toolchain so that its language drivers (gcc,g++,gfortran etc) instruct the system linker (ld) to link shared libraries on an as-needed basis. You have got one of those distros.
This means that when the linker finds -lz in the linkage sequence, and figures out that this refers to the shared library (say) /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so, it wants to know whether any references that it has added to your program that aren't yet defined have definitions that are exported by libz
If that is true, then the linker will not copy any chunks out of libz and add them to your program; instead, it will just doctor the code of your program so that:-
At runtime, the system program loader will load a copy of libz into the same process as your program whenever it loads a copy of your program, to run it.
At runtime, whenever your program refers to something that is defined in libz, that reference uses the definition exported by the copy of libz in the same process.
Your program wants to refer to just one thing that has a definition exported by libz, namely the function zlibVersion, which is referred to just once, in eg2.c. If the linker adds that reference to your program, and then finds the definition exported by libz, the reference is resolved
But when you try to link the program like:
gcc -o eg2 -lz eg2.o
the order of events is wrong in just the same way as with example 1. At the point when the linker finds -lz, there are no references to anything in the program: they are all in eg2.o, which has not yet been seen. So the linker decides it has no use for libz. When it reaches eg2.o, adds it to the program, and then has undefined reference to zlibVersion, the linkage sequence is finished; that reference is unresolved, and the linkage fails.
Lastly, the pkg-config variation of example 2 has a now obvious explanation. After shell-expansion:
gcc -o eg2 $(pkg-config --libs zlib) eg2.o
becomes:
gcc -o eg2 -lz eg2.o
which is just example 2 again.
I can reproduce the problem in example 1, but not in example 2
The linkage:
gcc -o eg2 -lz eg2.o
works just fine for you!
(Or: That linkage worked fine for you on, say, Fedora 23, but fails on Ubuntu 16.04)
That's because the distro on which the linkage works is one of the ones that does not configure its GCC toolchain to link shared libraries as-needed.
Back in the day, it was normal for unix-like systems to link static and shared libraries by different rules. Static libraries in a linkage sequence were linked on the as-needed basis explained in example 1, but shared libraries were linked unconditionally.
This behaviour is economical at linktime because the linker doesn't have to ponder whether a shared library is needed by the program: if it's a shared library, link it. And most libraries in most linkages are shared libraries. But there are disadvantages too:-
It is uneconomical at runtime, because it can cause shared libraries to be loaded along with a program even if doesn't need them.
The different linkage rules for static and shared libraries can be confusing to inexpert programmers, who may not know whether -lfoo in their linkage is going to resolve to /some/where/libfoo.a or to /some/where/libfoo.so, and might not understand the difference between shared and static libraries anyway.
This trade-off has led to the schismatic situation today. Some distros have changed their GCC linkage rules for shared libraries so that the as-needed principle applies for all libraries. Some distros have stuck with the old way.
Why do I still get this problem even if I compile-and-link at the same time?
If I just do:
$ gcc -o eg1 -I. -L. -lmy_lib eg1.c
surely gcc has to compile eg1.c first, and then link the resulting object file with libmy_lib.a. So how can it not know that object file is needed when it's doing the linking?
Because compiling and linking with a single command does not change the order of the linkage sequence.
When you run the command above, gcc figures out that you want compilation + linkage. So behind the scenes, it generates a compilation command, and runs it, then generates a linkage command, and runs it, as if you had run the two commands:
$ gcc -I. -c -o eg1.o eg1.c
$ gcc -o eg1 -L. -lmy_lib eg1.o
So the linkage fails just as it does if you do run those two commands. The only difference you notice in the failure is that gcc has generated a temporary object file in the compile + link case, because you're not telling it to use eg1.o. We see:
/tmp/ccQk1tvs.o: In function `main'
instead of:
eg1.o: In function `main':

The order in which interdependent linked libraries are specified is wrong
Putting interdependent libraries in the wrong order is just one way in which you can get files that need definitions of things coming later in the linkage than the files that provide the definitions. Putting libraries before the object files that refer to them is another way of making the same mistake.",2017-05-23 12:34:53Z,25
4032,12573816,JDiMatteo,1007353,"A wrapper around GNU ld that doesn't support linker scripts
Some .so files are actually GNU ld linker scripts, e.g. libtbb.so file is an ASCII text file with this contents:

Some more complex builds may not support this. For example, if you include -v in the compiler options, you can see that the mainwin gcc wrapper mwdip discards linker script command files in the verbose output list of libraries to link in. A simple work around is to replace the linker script input command file with a copy of the file instead (or a symlink), e.g.
cp libtbb.so.2 libtbb.so

4033,12573816,Niall,3747990,"Befriending templates...
Given the code snippet of a template type with a friend operator (or function);
template <typename T>
class Foo {
    friend std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os, const Foo<T>& a);
};
The operator<< is being declared as a non-template function. For every type T used with Foo, there needs to be a non-templated operator<<. For example, if there is a type Foo<int> declared, then there must be an operator implementation as follows;
std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os, const Foo<int>& a) {/*...*/}
Since it is not implemented, the linker fails to find it and results in the error.
To correct this, you can declare a template operator before the Foo type and then declare as a friend, the appropriate instantiation. The syntax is a little awkward, but is looks as follows;
// forward declare the Foo
template <typename>
class Foo;

// forward declare the operator <<
template <typename T>
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream&, const Foo<T>&);

template <typename T>
class Foo {
    friend std::ostream& operator<< <>(std::ostream& os, const Foo<T>& a);
    // note the required <>        ^^^^
    // ...
};

template <typename T>
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream&, const Foo<T>&)
{
  // ... implement the operator
}
The above code limits the friendship of the operator to the corresponding instantiation of Foo, i.e. the operator<< <int> instantiation is limited to access the private members of the instantiation of Foo<int>.
Alternatives include;
Allowing the friendship to extend to all instantiations of the templates, as follows;
template <typename T>
class Foo {
    template <typename T1>
    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Foo<T1>& a);
    // ...
};
Or, the implementation for the operator<< can be done inline inside the class definition;
template <typename T>
class Foo {
    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Foo& a)
    { /*...*/ }
    // ...
};
Note, when the declaration of the operator (or function) only appears in the class, the name is not available for ""normal"" lookup, only for argument dependent lookup, from cppreference;
A name first declared in a friend declaration within class or class template X becomes a member of the innermost enclosing namespace of X, but is not accessible for lookup (except argument-dependent lookup that considers X) unless a matching declaration at the namespace scope is provided...
There is further reading on template friends at cppreference and the C++ FAQ.

4034,12573816,Community,-1,"When your include paths are different
Linker errors can happen when a header file and its associated shared library (.lib file) go out of sync. Let me explain.
How do linkers work? The linker matches a function declaration (declared in the header) with its definition (in the shared library) by comparing their signatures. You can get a linker error if the linker doesn't find a function definition that matches perfectly.
Is it possible to still get a linker error even though the declaration and the definition seem to match? Yes! They might look the same in source code, but it really depends on what the compiler sees. Essentially you could end up with a situation like this:
// header1.h
typedef int Number;
void foo(Number);

// header2.h
typedef float Number;
void foo(Number); // this only looks the same lexically
Note how even though both the function declarations look identical in source code, but they are really different according to the compiler.
You might ask how one ends up in a situation like that? Include paths of course! If when compiling the shared library, the include path leads to header1.h and you end up using header2.h in your own program, you'll be left scratching your header wondering what happened (pun intended).
An example of how this can happen in the real world is explained below.
Further elaboration with an example
I have two projects: graphics.lib and main.exe. Both projects depend on common_math.h. Suppose the library exports the following function:
// graphics.lib    
#include ""common_math.h"" 
   
void draw(vec3 p) { ... } // vec3 comes from common_math.h
And then you go ahead and include the library in your own project.
// main.exe
#include ""other/common_math.h""
#include ""graphics.h""

int main() {
    draw(...);
}
Boom! You get a linker error and you have no idea why it's failing. The reason is that the common library uses different versions of the same include common_math.h (I have made it obvious here in the example by including a different path, but it might not always be so obvious. Maybe the include path is different in the compiler settings).
Note in this example, the linker would tell you it couldn't find draw(), when in reality you know it obviously is being exported by the library. You could spend hours scratching your head wondering what went wrong. The thing is, the linker sees a different signature because the parameter types are slightly different. In the example, vec3 is a different type in both projects as far as the compiler is concerned. This could happen because they come from two slightly different include files (maybe the include files come from two different versions of the library).
Debugging the linker
DUMPBIN is your friend, if you are using Visual Studio. I'm sure other compilers have other similar tools.
The process goes like this:
Note the weird mangled name given in the linker error. (eg. draw@graphics@XYZ).
Dump the exported symbols from the library into a text file.
Search for the exported symbol of interest, and notice that the mangled name is different.
Pay attention to why the mangled names ended up different. You would be able to see that the parameter types are different, even though they look the same in the source code.
Reason why they are different. In the example given above, they are different because of different include files.
[1] By project I mean a set of source files that are linked together to produce either a library or an executable.

4035,12573816,Niall,3747990,"Inconsistent UNICODE definitions
A Windows UNICODE build is built with TCHAR etc. being defined as wchar_t etc. When not building with UNICODE defined as build with TCHAR defined as char etc. These UNICODE and _UNICODE defines affect all the ""T"" string types; LPTSTR, LPCTSTR and their elk.
Building one library with UNICODE defined and attempting to link it in a project where UNICODE is not defined will result in linker errors since there will be a mismatch in the definition of TCHAR; char vs. wchar_t.
The error usually includes a function a value with a char or wchar_t derived type, these could include std::basic_string<> etc. as well. When browsing through the affected function in the code, there will often be a reference to TCHAR or std::basic_string<TCHAR> etc. This is a tell-tale sign that the code was originally intended for both a UNICODE and a Multi-Byte Character (or ""narrow"") build.
To correct this, build all the required libraries and projects with a consistent definition of UNICODE (and _UNICODE).
This can be done with either;
#define UNICODE
#define _UNICODE
Or in the project settings;
Project Properties > General > Project Defaults > Character Set
Or on the command line;
/DUNICODE /D_UNICODE
The alternative is applicable as well, if UNICODE is not intended to be used, make sure the defines are not set, and/or the multi-character setting is used in the projects and consistently applied.

Different versions of libraries
I was using an alias to refer to std::filesystem::path: filesystem is in the standard library since C++17 but my program needed to also compile in C++14 so I decided to use a variable alias:
#if (defined _GLIBCXX_EXPERIMENTAL_FILESYSTEM) //is the included filesystem library experimental? (C++14 and newer: <experimental/filesystem>)
using path_t = std::experimental::filesystem::path;
#elif (defined _GLIBCXX_FILESYSTEM) //not experimental (C++17 and newer: <filesystem>)
using path_t = std::filesystem::path;
#endif
Let's say I have three files: main.cpp, file.h, file.cpp:
file.h #include's <experimental::filesystem> and contains the code above
file.cpp, the implementation of file.h, #include's ""file.h""
main.cpp #include's <filesystem> and ""file.h""
Note the different libraries used in main.cpp and file.h. Since main.cpp #include'd ""file.h"" after <filesystem>, the version of filesystem used there was the C++17 one. I used to compile the program with the following commands:
$ g++ -g -std=c++17 -c main.cpp -> compiles main.cpp to main.o
$ g++ -g -std=c++17 -c file.cpp -> compiles file.cpp and file.h to file.o
$ g++ -g -std=c++17 -o executable main.o file.o -lstdc++fs -> links main.o and file.o
This way any function contained in file.o and used in main.o that required path_t gave ""undefined reference"" errors because main.o referred to std::filesystem::path but file.o to std::experimental::filesystem::path.
Resolution
To fix this I just needed to change <experimental::filesystem> in file.h to <filesystem>.",2019-07-29 13:01:59Z,10
4039,12573816,ead,5769463,"When linking against shared libraries, make sure that the used symbols are not hidden.
The default behavior of gcc is that all symbols are visible. However, when the translation units are built with option -fvisibility=hidden, only functions/symbols marked with __attribute__ ((visibility (""default""))) are external in the resulting shared object.
You can check whether the symbols your are looking for are external by invoking:
# -D shows (global) dynamic symbols that can be used from the outside of XXX.so
nm -D XXX.so | grep MY_SYMBOL 
the hidden/local symbols are shown by nm with lowercase symbol type, for example t instead of `T for code-section:
nm XXX.so
00000000000005a7 t HIDDEN_SYMBOL
00000000000005f8 T VISIBLE_SYMBOL
You can also use nm with the option -C to demangle the names (if C++ was used).
Similar to Windows-dlls, one would mark public functions with a define, for example DLL_PUBLIC defined as:
#define DLL_PUBLIC __attribute__ ((visibility (""default"")))

DLL_PUBLIC int my_public_function(){
  ...
}
Which roughly corresponds to Windows'/MSVC-version:
#ifdef BUILDING_DLL
    #define DLL_PUBLIC __declspec(dllexport) 
#else
    #define DLL_PUBLIC __declspec(dllimport) 
#endif
More information about visibility can be found on the gcc wiki.
When a translation unit is compiled with -fvisibility=hidden the resulting symbols have still external linkage (shown with upper case symbol type by nm) and can be used for external linkage without problem if the object files become part of a static libraries. The linkage becomes local only when the object files are linked into a shared library.
To find which symbols in an object file are hidden run:

not emitting any unique definition of gum, and therefore
not emitting any symbol by which the linker can refer to the definition of gum, and instead
replacing all calls to gum with inline copies of the compiled body of gum.
As a result, if you define gum inline in a source file gum.cpp, it is compiled to an object file gum.o in which all calls to gum are inlined and no symbol is defined by which the linker can refer to gum. When you link gum.o into a program together with another object file, e.g. main.o that make references to an external symbol gum, the linker cannot resolve those references. So the linkage fails:

You can only define gum as inline if the compiler can see its definition in every source file in which gum may be called. That means its inline definition needs to exist in a header file that you include in every source file you compile in which gum may be called. Do one of two things:
Either don't inline the definitions
Remove the inline specifier from the source file definition:

4059,2612802,wjandrea,4518341,"new_list = my_list doesn't actually create a second list. The assignment just copies the reference to the list, not the actual list, so both new_list and my_list refer to the same list after the assignment.
To actually copy the list, you have several options:
You can use the builtin list.copy() method (available since Python 3.3):
new_list = old_list.copy()
You can slice it:
new_list = old_list[:]
Alex Martelli's opinion (at least back in 2007) about this is, that it is a weird syntax and it does not make sense to use it ever. ;) (In his opinion, the next one is more readable).
You can use the built in list() constructor:
new_list = list(old_list)
You can use generic copy.copy():
import copy
new_list = copy.copy(old_list)
This is a little slower than list() because it has to find out the datatype of old_list first.
If you need to copy the elements of the list as well, use generic copy.deepcopy():
import copy
new_list = copy.deepcopy(old_list)
Obviously the slowest and most memory-needing method, but sometimes unavoidable. This operates recursively; it will handle any number of levels of nested lists (or other containers).
Example:
import copy

class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, val):
         self.val = val

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'Foo({self.val!r})'

foo = Foo(1)

a = ['foo', foo]
b = a.copy()
c = a[:]
d = list(a)
e = copy.copy(a)
f = copy.deepcopy(a)

# edit orignal list and instance 
a.append('baz')
foo.val = 5

print(f'original: {a}\nlist.copy(): {b}\nslice: {c}\nlist(): {d}\ncopy: {e}\ndeepcopy: {f}')
Result:
original: ['foo', Foo(5), 'baz']
list.copy(): ['foo', Foo(5)]
slice: ['foo', Foo(5)]
list(): ['foo', Foo(5)]
copy: ['foo', Foo(5)]
deepcopy: ['foo', Foo(1)]",2022-08-16 00:48:58Z,3924

10.59 sec (105.9 µs/itn) - copy.deepcopy(old_list)
10.16 sec (101.6 µs/itn) - pure Python Copy() method copying classes with deepcopy
1.488 sec (14.88 µs/itn) - pure Python Copy() method not copying classes (only dicts/lists/tuples)
0.325 sec (3.25 µs/itn) - for item in old_list: new_list.append(item)
0.217 sec (2.17 µs/itn) - [i for i in old_list] (a list comprehension)

0.075 sec (0.75 µs/itn) - list(old_list)
0.053 sec (0.53 µs/itn) - new_list = []; new_list.extend(old_list)
0.039 sec (0.39 µs/itn) - old_list[:] (list slicing)
So the fastest is list slicing. But be aware that copy.copy(), list[:] and list(list), unlike copy.deepcopy() and the python version don't copy any lists, dictionaries and class instances in the list, so if the originals change, they will change in the copied list too and vice versa.

4062,2612802,Russia Must Remove Putin,541136,"What are the options to clone or copy a list in Python?
In Python 3, a shallow copy can be made with:
a_copy = a_list.copy()
In Python 2 and 3, you can get a shallow copy with a full slice of the original:
a_copy = a_list[:]
Explanation
There are two semantic ways to copy a list. A shallow copy creates a new list of the same objects, a deep copy creates a new list containing new equivalent objects.
Shallow list copy
A shallow copy only copies the list itself, which is a container of references to the objects in the list. If the objects contained themselves are mutable and one is changed, the change will be reflected in both lists.
There are different ways to do this in Python 2 and 3. The Python 2 ways will also work in Python 3.
Python 2
In Python 2, the idiomatic way of making a shallow copy of a list is with a complete slice of the original:
a_copy = a_list[:]
You can also accomplish the same thing by passing the list through the list constructor,
a_copy = list(a_list)
but using the constructor is less efficient:
>>> timeit
>>> l = range(20)
>>> min(timeit.repeat(lambda: l[:]))
0.30504298210144043
>>> min(timeit.repeat(lambda: list(l)))
0.40698814392089844
Python 3
In Python 3, lists get the list.copy method:
a_copy = a_list.copy()
In Python 3.5:
>>> import timeit
>>> l = list(range(20))
>>> min(timeit.repeat(lambda: l[:]))
0.38448613602668047
>>> min(timeit.repeat(lambda: list(l)))
0.6309100328944623
>>> min(timeit.repeat(lambda: l.copy()))
0.38122922903858125
Making another pointer does not make a copy
Using new_list = my_list then modifies new_list every time my_list changes. Why is this?
my_list is just a name that points to the actual list in memory. When you say new_list = my_list you're not making a copy, you're just adding another name that points at that original list in memory. We can have similar issues when we make copies of lists.
>>> l = [[], [], []]
>>> l_copy = l[:]
>>> l_copy
[[], [], []]
>>> l_copy[0].append('foo')
>>> l_copy
[['foo'], [], []]
>>> l
[['foo'], [], []]
The list is just an array of pointers to the contents, so a shallow copy just copies the pointers, and so you have two different lists, but they have the same contents. To make copies of the contents, you need a deep copy.
Deep copies
To make a deep copy of a list, in Python 2 or 3, use deepcopy in the copy module:
import copy
a_deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(a_list)
To demonstrate how this allows us to make new sub-lists:
>>> import copy
>>> l
[['foo'], [], []]
>>> l_deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(l)
>>> l_deep_copy[0].pop()
'foo'
>>> l_deep_copy
[[], [], []]
>>> l
[['foo'], [], []]
And so we see that the deep copied list is an entirely different list from the original. You could roll your own function - but don't. You're likely to create bugs you otherwise wouldn't have by using the standard library's deepcopy function.
Don't use eval
You may see this used as a way to deepcopy, but don't do it:
problematic_deep_copy = eval(repr(a_list))
It's dangerous, particularly if you're evaluating something from a source you don't trust.
It's not reliable, if a subelement you're copying doesn't have a representation that can be eval'd to reproduce an equivalent element.
It's also less performant.
In 64 bit Python 2.7:
>>> import timeit
>>> import copy
>>> l = range(10)
>>> min(timeit.repeat(lambda: copy.deepcopy(l)))
27.55826997756958
>>> min(timeit.repeat(lambda: eval(repr(l))))
29.04534101486206
on 64 bit Python 3.5:
>>> import timeit
>>> import copy
>>> l = list(range(10))
>>> min(timeit.repeat(lambda: copy.deepcopy(l)))
16.84255409205798
>>> min(timeit.repeat(lambda: eval(repr(l))))

4063,2612802,Peter Mortensen,63550,"Let's start from the beginning and explore this question.
So let's suppose you have two lists:
list_1 = ['01', '98']
list_2 = [['01', '98']]
And we have to copy both lists, now starting from the first list:
So first let's try by setting the variable copy to our original list, list_1:
copy = list_1
Now if you are thinking copy copied the list_1, then you are wrong. The id function can show us if two variables can point to the same object. Let's try this:
print(id(copy))
print(id(list_1))
The output is:
4329485320
4329485320
Both variables are the exact same argument. Are you surprised?
So as we know, Python doesn't store anything in a variable, Variables are just referencing to the object and object store the value. Here object is a list but we created two references to that same object by two different variable names. This means that both variables are pointing to the same object, just with different names.
When you do copy = list_1, it is actually doing:
Here in the image list_1 and copy are two variable names, but the object is same for both variable which is list.
So if you try to modify copied list then it will modify the original list too because the list is only one there, you will modify that list no matter you do from the copied list or from the original list:
copy[0] = ""modify""

print(copy)
print(list_1)
Output:
['modify', '98']
['modify', '98']
So it modified the original list:
Now let's move onto a Pythonic method for copying lists.
copy_1 = list_1[:]
This method fixes the first issue we had:
print(id(copy_1))
print(id(list_1))

4338792136
4338791432
So as we can see our both list having different id and it means that both variables are pointing to different objects. So what actually going on here is:
Now let's try to modify the list and let's see if we still face the previous problem:
copy_1[0] = ""modify""

print(list_1)
print(copy_1)
The output is:
['01', '98']
['modify', '98']
As you can see, it only modified the copied list. That means it worked.
Do you think we're done? No. Let's try to copy our nested list.
copy_2 = list_2[:]
list_2 should reference to another object which is copy of list_2. Let's check:
print(id((list_2)), id(copy_2))
We get the output:
4330403592 4330403528
Now we can assume both lists are pointing different object, so now let's try to modify it and let's see it is giving what we want:
copy_2[0][1] = ""modify""

print(list_2, copy_2)
This gives us the output:
[['01', 'modify']] [['01', 'modify']]
This may seem a little bit confusing, because the same method we previously used worked. Let's try to understand this.
When you do:
copy_2 = list_2[:]
You're only copying the outer list, not the inside list. We can use the id function once again to check this.
print(id(copy_2[0]))
print(id(list_2[0]))
The output is:
4329485832
4329485832
When we do copy_2 = list_2[:], this happens:
It creates the copy of list, but only outer list copy, not the nested list copy. The nested list is same for both variable, so if you try to modify the nested list then it will modify the original list too as the nested list object is same for both lists.
What is the solution? The solution is the deepcopy function.
from copy import deepcopy
deep = deepcopy(list_2)
Let's check this:
print(id((list_2)), id(deep))

4322146056 4322148040
Both outer lists have different IDs. Let's try this on the inner nested lists.
print(id(deep[0]))
print(id(list_2[0]))
The output is:
4322145992
4322145800
As you can see both IDs are different, meaning we can assume that both nested lists are pointing different object now.
This means when you do deep = deepcopy(list_2) what actually happens:
Both nested lists are pointing different object and they have separate copy of nested list now.
Now let's try to modify the nested list and see if it solved the previous issue or not:
deep[0][1] = ""modify""
print(list_2, deep)
It outputs:
[['01', '98']] [['01', 'modify']]
As you can see, it didn't modify the original nested list, it only modified the copied list.",2021-05-11 21:53:58Z,74
4064,2612802,jack,894381,"There are many answers already that tell you how to make a proper copy, but none of them say why your original 'copy' failed.
Python doesn't store values in variables; it binds names to objects. Your original assignment took the object referred to by my_list and bound it to new_list as well. No matter which name you use there is still only one list, so changes made when referring to it as my_list will persist when referring to it as new_list. Each of the other answers to this question give you different ways of creating a new object to bind to new_list.
Each element of a list acts like a name, in that each element binds non-exclusively to an object. A shallow copy creates a new list whose elements bind to the same objects as before.
new_list = list(my_list)  # or my_list[:], but I prefer this syntax
# is simply a shorter way of:
new_list = [element for element in my_list]
To take your list copy one step further, copy each object that your list refers to, and bind those element copies to a new list.
import copy  
# each element must have __copy__ defined for this...
new_list = [copy.copy(element) for element in my_list]
This is not yet a deep copy, because each element of a list may refer to other objects, just like the list is bound to its elements. To recursively copy every element in the list, and then each other object referred to by each element, and so on: perform a deep copy.
import copy
# each element must have __deepcopy__ defined for this...

Here are the timing results using Python 3.6.8. Keep in mind these times are relative to one another, not absolute.
I stuck to only doing shallow copies, and also added some new methods that weren't possible in Python 2, such as list.copy() (the Python 3 slice equivalent) and two forms of list unpacking (*new_list, = list and new_list = [*list]):
METHOD                TIME TAKEN
b = [*a]               2.75180600000021
b = a * 1              3.50215399999990
b = a[:]               3.78278899999986  # Python 2 winner (see above)
b = a.copy()           4.20556500000020  # Python 3 ""slice equivalent"" (see above)
b = []; b.extend(a)    4.68069800000012
b = a[0:len(a)]        6.84498999999959
*b, = a                7.54031799999984
b = list(a)            7.75815899999997
b = [i for i in a]    18.4886440000000
b = copy.copy(a)      18.8254879999999
b = []
for item in a:
  b.append(item)      35.4729199999997
We can see the Python 2 winner still does well, but doesn't edge out Python 3 list.copy() by much, especially considering the superior readability of the latter.
The dark horse is the unpacking and repacking method (b = [*a]), which is ~25% faster than raw slicing, and more than twice as fast as the other unpacking method (*b, = a).
b = a * 1 also does surprisingly well.
Note that these methods do not output equivalent results for any input other than lists. They all work for sliceable objects, a few work for any iterable, but only copy.copy() works for more general Python objects.

4068,2612802,Community,-1,"All of the other contributors gave great answers, which work when you have a single dimension (leveled) list, however of the methods mentioned so far, only copy.deepcopy() works to clone/copy a list and not have it point to the nested list objects when you are working with multidimensional, nested lists (list of lists). While Felix Kling refers to it in his answer, there is a little bit more to the issue and possibly a workaround using built-ins that might prove a faster alternative to deepcopy.
While new_list = old_list[:], copy.copy(old_list)' and for Py3k old_list.copy() work for single-leveled lists, they revert to pointing at the list objects nested within the old_list and the new_list, and changes to one of the list objects are perpetuated in the other.
Edit: New information brought to light
As was pointed out by both Aaron Hall and PM 2Ring using eval() is not only a bad idea, it is also much slower than copy.deepcopy().
This means that for multidimensional lists, the only option is copy.deepcopy(). With that being said, it really isn't an option as the performance goes way south when you try to use it on a moderately sized multidimensional array. I tried to timeit using a 42x42 array, not unheard of or even that large for bioinformatics applications, and I gave up on waiting for a response and just started typing my edit to this post.
It would seem that the only real option then is to initialize multiple lists and work on them independently. If anyone has any other suggestions, for how to handle multidimensional list copying, it would be appreciated.
As others have stated, there are significant performance issues using the copy module and copy.deepcopy for multidimensional lists.",2020-06-20 09:12:55Z,22

Try to understand this. Let's say that my_list is in the heap memory at location X, i.e., my_list is pointing to the X. Now by assigning new_list = my_list you're letting new_list point to the X. This is known as a shallow copy.
Now if you assign new_list = my_list[:], you're simply copying each object of my_list to new_list. This is known as a deep copy.

import copy

4072,2612802,Corman,11741338,"I wanted to post something a bit different than some of the other answers. Even though this is most likely not the most understandable, or fastest option, it provides a bit of an inside view of how deep copy works, as well as being another alternative option for deep copying. It doesn't really matter if my function has bugs, since the point of this is to show a way to copy objects like the question answers, but also to use this as a point to explain how deepcopy works at its core.
At the core of any deep copy function is way to make a shallow copy. How? Simple. Any deep copy function only duplicates the containers of immutable objects. When you deepcopy a nested list, you are only duplicating the outer lists, not the mutable objects inside of the lists. You are only duplicating the containers. The same works for classes, too. When you deepcopy a class, you deepcopy all of its mutable attributes. So, how? How come you only have to copy the containers, like lists, dicts, tuples, iters, classes, and class instances?
It's simple. A mutable object can't really be duplicated. It can never be changed, so it is only a single value. That means you never have to duplicate strings, numbers, bools, or any of those. But how would you duplicate the containers? Simple. You make just initialize a new container with all of the values. Deepcopy relies on recursion. It duplicates all the containers, even ones with containers inside of them, until no containers are left. A container is an immutable object.
Once you know that, completely duplicating an object without any references is pretty easy. Here's a function for deepcopying basic data-types (wouldn't work for custom classes but you could always add that)
def deepcopy(x):
  immutables = (str, int, bool, float)
  mutables = (list, dict, tuple)
  if isinstance(x, immutables):
    return x
  elif isinstance(x, mutables):
    if isinstance(x, tuple):
      return tuple(deepcopy(list(x)))
    elif isinstance(x, list):
      return [deepcopy(y) for y in x]
    elif isinstance(x, dict):
      values = [deepcopy(y) for y in list(x.values())]
      keys = list(x.keys())
      return dict(zip(keys, values))
Python's own built-in deepcopy is based around that example. The only difference is it supports other types, and also supports user-classes by duplicating the attributes into a new duplicate class, and also blocks infinite-recursion with a reference to an object it's already seen using a memo list or dictionary. And that's really it for making deep copies. At its core, making a deep copy is just making shallow copies. I hope this answer adds something to the question.
EXAMPLES
Say you have this list: [1, 2, 3]. The immutable numbers cannot be duplicated, but the other layer can. You can duplicate it using a list comprehension: [x for x in [1, 2, 3]]
Now, imagine you have this list: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]. This time, you want to make a function, which uses recursion to deep copy all layers of the list. Instead of the previous list comprehension:
[x for x in _list]
It uses a new one for lists:
[deepcopy_list(x) for x in _list]
And deepcopy_list looks like this:
def deepcopy_list(x):
  if isinstance(x, (str, bool, float, int)):
    return x
  else:
    return [deepcopy_list(y) for y in x]
Then now you have a function which can deepcopy any list of strs, bools, floast, ints and even lists to infinitely many layers using recursion. And there you have it, deepcopying.
TLDR: Deepcopy uses recursion to duplicate objects, and merely returns the same immutable objects as before, as immutable objects cannot be duplicated. However, it deepcopies the most inner layers of mutable objects until it reaches the outermost mutable layer of an object.",2021-08-26 16:10:55Z,13

4080,2612802,Karl Knechtel,523612,"Frame challenge: do you actually need to copy, for your application?
I often see code that tries to modify a copy of the list in some iterative fashion. To construct a trivial example, suppose we had non-working (because x should not be modified) code like:
x = [8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9]
y = x
for index, element in enumerate(y):
    y[index] = element * 2
# Expected result:
# x = [8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9] <-- this is where the code is wrong.
# y = [16, 12, 14, 10, 6, 0, 18]
Naturally people will ask how to make y be a copy of x, rather than a name for the same list, so that the for loop will do the right thing.
But this is the wrong approach. Functionally, what we really want to do is make a new list that is based on the original.
We don't need to make a copy first to do that, and we typically shouldn't.
When we need to apply logic to each element
The natural tool for this is a list comprehension. This way, we write the logic that tells us how the elements in the desired result, relate to the original elements. It's simple, elegant and expressive; and we avoid the need for workarounds to modify the y copy in a for loop (since assigning to the iteration variable doesn't affect the list - for the same reason that we wanted the copy in the first place!).
For the above example, it looks like:
x = [8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9]
y = [element * 2 for element in x]
List comprehensions are quite powerful; we can also use them to filter out elements by a rule with an if clause, and we can chain for and if clauses (it works like the corresponding imperative code, with the same clauses in the same order; only the value that will ultimately end up in the result list, is moved to the front instead of being in the ""innermost"" part). If the plan was to iterate over the original while modifying the copy to avoid problems, there is generally a much more pleasant way to do that with a filtering list comprehension.
When we need to reject or insert specific elements by position
Suppose instead that we had something like
x = [8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9]
y = x
del y[2:-2] # oops, x was changed inappropriately
Rather than making y a separate copy first in order to delete the part we don't want, we can build a list by putting together the parts that we do want. Thus:
x = [8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9]
y = x[:2] + x[-2:]
Handling insertion, replacement etc. by slicing is left as an exercise. Just reason out which subsequences you want the result to contain. A special case of this is making a reversed copy - assuming we need a new list at all (rather than just to iterate in reverse), we can directly create it by slicing, rather than cloning and then using .reverse.
These approaches - like the list comprehension - also have the advantage that they create the desired result as an expression, rather than by procedurally modifying an existing object in-place (and returning None). This is more convenient for writing code in a ""fluent"" style.",2022-09-23 17:19:15Z,0
4081,2612802,Fellipe Sanches,6036169,"Short and simple explanations of each copy mode:
A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts references into it to the objects found in the original - creating a shallow copy:
new_list = my_list
A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original - creating a deep copy:
new_list = list(my_list)
list() works fine for deep copy of simple lists, like:
my_list = [""A"",""B"",""C""]
But, for complex lists like...
my_complex_list = [{'A' : 500, 'B' : 501},{'C' : 502}]
...use deepcopy():

As a result, I am providing you with an alternative solution to your problem that I believe will be helpful to you.
You can get the query string by putting the below function in your JS file.
function getQueryString() {
    let string = [], hash;
    let hashes = window.location.href.slice(window.location.href.indexOf('?') + 1).split('&');
    for (var i = 0; i < hashes.length; i++) {
        hash = hashes[i].split('=');
        string.push(hash[0]);
        string[hash[0]] = hash[1];
    }
    return string;
}
You can get the value of a query string like let status = getQueryString()[""status""]; and pass it to the data in your ajax call.
function load_more_posts(offset, post_type) {
    let status = getQueryString()[""status""];
    $.ajax({
        type: ""POST"",
        url: WPURLS.ajax_url,
        data: {
            action: ""load_more_members"",
            offset: offset,
            post_type: post_type,
            status: status
        },
        beforeSend: function (data) {
            $("".load-more-"" + post_type).addClass(""loading"");
        },
        success: function (response) {
            var obj = JSON.parse(response);
            $(""."" + post_type + ""-repeat"").append(obj.html);
        },

UseCases are single responsiblity classes that handle business logic as stated in The Clean Architecture by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)
Use Cases The software in this layer contains application specific business rules. It encapsulates and implements all of the use cases of the system. These use cases orchestrate the flow of data to and from the entities, and direct those entities to use their enterprise wide business rules to achieve the goals of the use case.
We do not expect changes in this layer to affect the entities. We also do not expect this layer to be affected by changes to externalities such as the database, the UI, or any of the common frameworks. This layer is isolated from such concerns.
And official Android document for Android what's domain layer and how you can use it with Jetpack Compose. You can check out JetNews app or ioshed app for more details either.

4108,74579121,Charles Han,11514907,"Depending on how far you want to go, there are some concepts you can follow.
The first one is Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). You could extract the weight calculation to a new method, like,
private static double GetWeightForPlanet(double weightEarth, double earthG, double planetG)
{
      double weightPanet = (weightEarth / earthG) * planetG;
      weightPanet = Math.Round(weightPanet, 2);
      return weightPanet;
}
Now your program will look like this,
//Calculating mass of object by dividing and gravitional force by multiplication
double weightMercury = GetWeightForPlanet(weightEarth, earthG, mercuryG);
double weightMars = GetWeightForPlanet(weightEarth, earthG, marsG);
double weightUranus = GetWeightForPlanet(weightEarth, earthG, uranusG);
double weightVenus = GetWeightForPlanet(weightEarth, earthG, venusG);
double weightSaturn = GetWeightForPlanet(weightEarth, earthG, saturnG);
double weightNeptune = GetWeightForPlanet(weightEarth, earthG, neptuneG);
double weightJupiter = GetWeightForPlanet(weightEarth, earthG, jupiterG);

Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Blue;
Console.WriteLine(""\r\nYou weight:"");
Console.WriteLine(weightMercury + ""kg on Mercury"");
Console.WriteLine(weightMars + ""kg on Mars"");
Console.WriteLine(weightUranus + ""kg on Uranus"");
Console.WriteLine(weightVenus + ""kg on Venus"");
Console.WriteLine(weightSaturn + ""kg on Saturn"");
Console.WriteLine(weightNeptune + ""kg on Neptune"");
Console.WriteLine(weightJupiter + ""kg on Jupiter"");
There is still some repeating code, but I can see some common data patterns. Maybe a data structure will help; let's introduce the concept (class) Planet,
public class Planet
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public double Gforce { get; set; }
}
Your code will look like this,
double earthG = 9.81, weightEarth;

var planets = new List<Planet>
{
       new Planet { Name = ""Mercury"", Gforce = 3.7 },
       new Planet { Name = ""Mars"", Gforce = 3.711},
       new Planet { Name = ""Uranus"", Gforce = 8.69 },
       new Planet { Name = ""Saturn"", Gforce = 10.44 },
       new Planet { Name = ""Neptune"", Gforce = 11.15 },
       new Planet { Name = ""Venus"", Gforce = 8.87 },
       new Planet { Name = ""Jupiter"", Gforce = 24.79 }
};

//Receive user input
Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Green;
Console.WriteLine(""This program will calculate how much you will weight on all planets"");
Console.Write(""Type in your weight in kg: "");
weightEarth = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Blue;

Console.WriteLine(""\r\nYou weight:"");

foreach (var planet in planets)
{
     Console.WriteLine($""{GetWeightForPlanet(weightEarth, earthG, planet.Gforce)} kg on {planet.Name}"");
